(Short turn around since the last progress report, so this will be
shorter but will hopefully get us back on the regular schedule).
</p>

<p>
My personal habits have been all good. I have started to ramp back up
on lifting, but need to start working more kettle bells. The diet has
been in check and just finished another easy four-day fast. I have
been playing some great basketball and have had lots of fun hanging
out with Clay and Steve, will try to put more work in with them.
</p>

<p>
I have realized that my biggest priority should be the placement of my
people. At some level I knew this before, but in these past weeks I
have really internalized it. Ive been putting a lot of work into Wes'
postdoc application. Its really coming along; there is more work
needed, but we will get there. I also put a decent amount of time into
Manfred's letter, which is along the same lines.

Chuyuan did his annual review. It went very smooth, apparently there
doesn't need to be someone outside of HEP on the these committee. This
will make it go very smooth. He needs to get his thesis going and then
starting thinking about what he wants to do afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The 4b progress has been steady. We have now understood the lower ZH
sensitivity, it was from missing the gg-&gt;ZH sample. We have have
passed on to the L2 review and expect this to be smooth. The next
steps are to try to model the synthetic data. This will be a great
opportunity to really exercise the new FvT code. Chuyuan is working on
a refit of the background with the finalized selection. Alejandro is
looking into the kappa lambda scans, which are still not understood.
</p>

<p>
HGC is ramping up. We are starting to make modules regularly. Josh
will start next week and there has been movement on Ornella. I need to
go through the other applications for the next round.
