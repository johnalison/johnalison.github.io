How to learn from History/Literature ?
</p>

<p>
&gt; Ignore facts and figures.  Focus on the moral lessions, what the
&gt; characters teach you about life.

Role of radicals:
</p>

<p>
&gt; Claim: The dangerous thing abou the French Revolution and the
  Soviet Unions early days was that they were casueswhere radicals
  got hold of an entire country. They then became hot-beds for
  radical thinking. Claim is that they had a major impact on ~All
  europe and the US. Leead to US extreme panic during the red scare.
</p></li>

<li>World went from having 0 communist countries to having a significant fraction of the world (on all continents) be communist in ~30 years.</li>

<li>“The dead outnumber the living 14 to 1, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.”</li>

<li>Vietnam
&gt; For the Vietnamese end game was political power, not body count. They were able to "lose" battles in terms of body count, if it furthered the long-term agenda. 
&gt; Very hard for the other side to win a war like that. Was a watershed moment in US culture: Changed trust in goverment. Broke the army. Major impact on US foreign policy.</li>

<li>10k Greeks
&gt; - Mercenaries fighting in Persia in 400 BCE

&gt; - Stranded 2000 miles from home in enemy territory 
&gt; - Made a deal to secure safe passage, but are betrayed. ~All thier commanders murdered or captured.
&gt; - Xenaphone who was a common soldier takes on role of leader (Eternal Optimist) 
&gt; - End up fighting thier way out of Persia
&gt; - Some point end up camping in the ruins of Nenevah. Have no clue what it is. Buts its clear to them that its the remants of a civilizatoin that was more powerful than any they have ever come across before (and it was now in ruins!) Dan Carlin "Statue of Liberty in the sand"</li>

History as a River (Will Durrant) 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the cause of our contemporary pessimism is our tendency to view history as a turbulent stream of conflicts between individuals in economic life, between groups in politics, between creeds in religions, between states in war. This is the more dramatic side of history. It captures the eye of the historian and the interest of the reader, but if we turn from that Mississippi of strife how with hate and dark with blood, to look upon the banks of the stream we find quieter, but more inspiring scenes, women rearing children, men building houses, peasants drawing food from the soil, artisans making the conveniences of life, statesman sometimes organizing peace instead of war, teachers forming savages into citizens, musicians taming our hearts with harmony and rhythm, scientists patiently accumulating knowledge, philosophers groping for truth, saints suggesting the wisdom of love. History has too often been a picture of the bloody stream. They history of civilization is a record of what happened on the banks.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Historians seek to understand the development of inter-subjective entities like gods and nations, whereas biologists hardly recognize the existence of such things. To think historically means to ascribe real power to the contents of our imaginary stories</li>
