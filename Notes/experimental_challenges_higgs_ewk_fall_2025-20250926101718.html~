<li><b>Intro</b>: Its great to be here. I want to thaink the organizers for teh
invitation. They have asked me to give a summary of the field to set
the stage for the rest of the week. So I will give what I think are
the big open questions, hot topics and the important experimental
challegnes. This will be from an experimentalists POV and of course
I cannot be exhaustive in this introduciton, but will highlihgt
things that I think are particularly important. I will try to
exagruate my positions to make the talk more interesting</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>s1</b>: The first big hot topic is this conference. I get the sense,
  especially these days, that most conferences are somewhat overrated
  rated. They tend to have broad surveys from the experiments that are
  more of PR statements than anything else. Thats not the case for
  this conferences. I have seen alot of familiar faces here and a lot
  young faces. Whats nice about this conference is that because its so
  focused, you tend to get the people who actually do the analyses So
  while most conferences are somewaht overrated, I would say Higgs is
  underrated.
</p>

<p>
Organizers did a good job putting together an exciting program, and
 so the plot of my talk is just to follow the program I will say
 somehting about HIggs perceision measurements, BSM higgs, Di-Higgs
 and something about the future of the Higgs program
</p>

<p>
<b>s2</b> Ok coming first to HIggs precision measuremnts. Coupling
measurements is the major part of the program. The Sensitivity is
dominated by the "Big 5" ZZ, WW, gg. bb, and, tau tau There is not so
much to say here, Experimentally we know what we are doing, these
measurements have been done for over 10 yearss, we have achieved
O(10%) percisions
</p>

<p>
If there is an experimental challeges it is in sustaining momentum.
These measurements used to be the marques analyses within the
collaboration, wth the best people working on them. Now, I get the
sense that its hard to attract students and postdocs to them. This is
somehing we need to do a better job doing within the collaborations.
Saying this here is Like preaching to the choir&#x2026; This is what this
conference series is all about. But we need to remind our collqueses
and students and this is really the front lines. In many models this
is where we will see the deviation first in bb or ZZ.

As you know, this year’s edition of the Higgs Conference is taking place at Brown from October
27th to 31st. To frame the scientific program, we would like to have an experimental opening
talk on the current big questions and hot topics on Higgs &amp; EWK physics. This talk would not be
directly on behalf of ATLAS and CMS, but it should be the view of the challenges we currently
have from an experimentalist's point of view. We would like to ask you if you would be willing to
present this talk. We certainly would like you to be on board. Please let us know as soon as
possible. 
</p>

<p>
More:
</p>

<p>
We were thinking of something relative short. Would 15-20 mins do? We can adjust, but the spirit was of having something to the point on the big questions without the detail which in principle would be then tackled by the conference it self (one can always dream big).
</p>

<p>
No, there should not be a corresponding theory talk, at least for now.
</p>

<p>
To mirror your talk we are looking for two similar talks at closing (experiment and theory) for the upcoming next steps given what was presented during the conference.
</p>

<p>
Arely and Loukas may correct me if I said something outside of what we were thinking or if I forgot something.
