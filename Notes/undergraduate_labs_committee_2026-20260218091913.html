Comments on Mossbauer:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1) I haven't had problems with the current system.</li>
<li>2) I looked at some of the replacement proposals&#x2026; The complete
"black box" units are nice if you just care about analyzing the
results, but not so great if you want to understand the physics
(and limitations) of the measurement. I think it's probably not
what we want to do in MPL. They are also very expensive (we don't
need cryo). I like the option of the drop-in replacements.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can't we get FSM to do all the facility upgrades?
eg: Lighting, repainting, whiteboards, floors</li>

<li>And we shouodl ping Reinhard and Barry &#x2026;. (probably my biggest contribution!)</li>
