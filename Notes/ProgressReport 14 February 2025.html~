I've started lifting again, its slow and steady. I did a set of
kettlebells and it felt great! I have a new lifting plan that I got
from the Peter Attia podcast. I'm going to try to go hard for 30-45
mins with paired exercises that target different muscle groups. This
will allow me to do the sets back-to-back with little or no rest in
between. Basketball has been good, I've been playing well and having
fun. All habits are in check. I would say I still need some more
meditation and would like to do more 4b work. My writing habits are
steady.
</p>

<p>
On the four-b side we have been making nice progress. The lambda scan
is now understood and looks as expected. We got a round of comments
from the L2 conveners and have a first pass at the answers. There was
nothing major, with some good points (eg: symmetric trigger weights
systematics) and some action items to follow up on. We got a
significant improvement in the expected limits, now ~5.5, after
removing events with anomalously large signal weights.

<p>
Most of my work has been focused on the synthetic datasets. I've
started doing the closure with one of the seeds. This has been an
opportunity to test the new FvT code, the interface is very nice, much
better than before. Im still debugging the fits, but they seem to show
the same problems that Marina is seeing with the Run3 synthetic
datasets. The next step is to isolate the phase space in the synthetic
data that is the least well-modeled by the 3b. Im guessing that this
will point to shortcomings of the synthetic data. I have a good idea
about how to improve the modeling of the jet masses in the synthetic
data, I will re-compute the masses based on the final pT.
</p>

<p>
Aniket gave a great talk in bbWW! We will proceed with adding the low
pT jets and will now move to doing this in Run-3. This will should
bring much more integration with the rest of the group.
</p>

<p>
Lots of steady progress on HGC. Ornella and Josh have started and we
are moving on another Ad. We have finalized a plan for the shipping
containers and should will get new tooling soon.
