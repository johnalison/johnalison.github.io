Mostly prattle. Some bold comments (below), with nothing really to back them up.
</p>

<p>
Best parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer.</li>
<li>We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies.</li>
<li>We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else.</li>
<li>Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company.</li>
</ul>
