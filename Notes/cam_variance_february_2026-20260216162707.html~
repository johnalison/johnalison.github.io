<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$702k in the cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU). The variance
is from the assembly and testing of the first 48% of modules and the
associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts
(baseplates). CMU has received baseplates has resumed production in
January and February. Shipment of the CuT baseplates from UCSB are
arrivig soon. CMU has demonstrated the 12 modules / day protocol now.
We are currently hiring another technician to get us up to 16/day.
</p>

<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$526k in cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2. This is expected
and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed
below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost
variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.

<h2 id="orgb790cb7">Impact</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb790cb7">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream
delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test
stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the
components become available, the value will be earned, and it should
not impact the overall schedule.

765
</p>

<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$765k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two
components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping
of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-48%); the remainder is
for supporting production at other assembly sites. This past month
UCSB has continued to produce modules with 16/day protocol and is
catching up earning value given the availible input parts.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$977k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is
consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed above.
Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance
resulting from labor costs not earning value.

<p>
There is a current cost variance of -$178k which is the result of
January actuals reflecting a sum of several months of labor for module
assembly at UCSB (Task: 402.44.501791 CE-UCSB Module Assembly MIE-C
UNIV Labor).
