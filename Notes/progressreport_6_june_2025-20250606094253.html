Once again, another slow fortnight. I've done a lot of work getting
processes dialed in. In Emacs, I have now sorted out buffers, Ediff,
world clock, and have a new theme. I think I'm in a good spot; time to
get back to work. My habits have all been good, but I need more
meditation. I've accomplished a lot around the house in the last two
weeks. I reinstalled the awning and set up a new umbrella for the
deck. This is now in a good spot.
</p>

<p>
On the 4b side, we had the pre-approval. This went well, and we are
proceeding to unblinding. Sindhu is starting to do more, and Chance
and Lei are ramping up. I've gotten Alejandro's code to run on Rogue;
it's seamless. The undergraduate student fell through; easy come, easy
go.

I'm in a good position with the synthetic datasets. The big question
is: what do I want to do next? I think I should give another talk in
Hbb about the Run-3 synthetic data. I need to finish running the
N-seeds; I've already done 2 out of 16. After that, two interesting
next steps are HbbReclustering and migrating the hemisphere mixing.
I've started to set up the studies for the HbbReclustering. This might
be a good project to hand off to a student&#x2026; maybe Christian? I think
the mixing is something I want to handle. Perhaps I should try setting
this up with Cursor?
</p>

<p>
On the HGC side, Jacques has started, and the final tooling is being
checked out. However, the base plates are delayed, so the production
in the near term will likely be v3b on CuT. I did the directors'
review at FNAL. I executed well. It's not clear how useful the review
was; it was probably more for management, but the social aspect was
well worth it for me. I saw Scott while I was there. He seems to be
doing okay, but he appeared a little emotionally fragile&#x2026;
