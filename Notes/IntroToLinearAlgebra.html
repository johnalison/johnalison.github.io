<h2 id="orga5de880">Introduction to Linear Algebra (Gilbert Strang)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga5de880">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very good. Suprisingly quick read.</li>

<li>Each column j of AB is A times column j of B</li>

<li>The four fundamental subspaces.</li>

<li>The vectors in the nullspace (prependicular to all the rows) solve Ax = 0, the most basic of linear equations</li>

<li>The number of independent columns equals the number of independent rows.
The first great theorem in linear algebra</li>

<li>Learning from Data: Instead of solving matrix equations or diff eqs. that express known input-output rules, we have to find those rules.</li>

<li>Basic property of a plane: halfway between any two points on the surface is another point on the surface.</li>

<li>p12 How to remeber trigID cosA cosB + sinA sinB = cos(B-A)
v = (cos A , sinA) w = (cos B , sin B)  v &sdot; w = 1*cos(delta Phi) = cos (B-A)</li>

<li><p>
How does an m x n matrix (A) multiply a n x 1 matrix (x)  ?
Two ways of looking:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Row picture: Ax will come from dot products of x aith the rows of A</li>
<li>Column picture: will come from linear combinations of the columns of A</li>
</ul>

<p>
You tend to use dot products to compute
But to understand Ax the column picture is better
    "The column vector Ax is a combination of the columns of A"
</p></li>

<li>Independence means: The only combination that produces Ax = 0 is x = 0</li>

<li>We can only solve Ax = v when v is in the column space of A C(A).</li>

<li>The best way to understand an important idea is to see it early and often.
It is examples more than definitions that make ideas clear &#x2013; in mathematics and in life.</li>

<li>The building bloack of all matrices. Every matrix of rank r is the sum of r matrices of rank one.</li>

<li><p>
A = CR where C has the same column space as A and R has the same row space as A. 
</p>

<p>
The r colums of C are a basis for the column space of A.
The r rows of R are a basis for the row space of A.
</p>

<p>
C contains the r independent columns of A.
R tells how to combine those columns to give all columns of A
  (R contains I b/c r columns of A are already in C)
</p></li>

<li>What makes this subject easy: All the equations are linear
What makes this subject hard: So many equations and unknowns and ideas</li>

<li>What to expect from a random m by n matrix A:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m&lt;n: Many solutions to the m equations Ax=b</li>
<li>m=n: Probably one solution to the n equations Ax=b</li>
<li>m&gt;n Probably no solutions: too many equations with only n unknowns in x</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The rank r tells us the real size of our problem.</li>

<li>Over and over &#x2013; for Ax, AB, and CR we write about linear combinations of columns of A or C.
Not about the dot products with the rows!</li>

<li>Permutation matrices have a 1 in every row and every column. All else is 0.
When it acts on a vector it changes the order of its components.</li>

<li><p>
T is inside:  The dot product or inner product is x<sup>T</sup> y (1xn)(nx1)  = 1 x 1
T is outside: The rank one product or outer product is x y<sup>T</sup> (nx1)(1xn)  = n x n
</p>

<p>
x<sup>T</sup> y is a number. x y<sup>T</sup> is a matrix
In QM, &lt;x|y&gt; vs |x&gt;&lt;y|
</p></li>

<li><p>
We defined A<sup>T</sup> by flipping the matrix accross its main diagonal. Thats not mathematics.
There is a better definition. A<sup>T</sup> is thematrix that makes these inner products equal.
</p>

<p>
(Ax)<sup>T</sup> y = x<sup>T</sup>(A<sup>Ty</sup>)  Inner product of Ax with y = Inner product of x with A<sup>Ty</sup>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Change the matrix to a derivative A=d/dt.
Can find the transpose of d/dt form the above rule:  (Ax)<sup>T</sup> y = x<sup>T</sup>(A<sup>Ty</sup>)
  =&gt; integration by parts A<sup>T</sup> = -A = - d/dt
</p>

<p>
The derivative is anti-symmetric
</p></li>

<li>Most scientific problems that start with a rectangular matrix A end up with A<sup>TA</sup> or AA<sup>T</sup> or both.</li>

<li>The null spaces of invertiable matrices contain only the zero vector.</li>

<li>Now (Ch3) we allow every m x n matrix, there will surely be nonzero solutions to Ax=0 if n&gt;m.
This is probably the most important chapter in the book.</li>

<li>A line in R<sup>n</sup> is not a vector space unless it goes through the origin.</li>

<li>Invertible matrices are not a subspace of all 3x3 matricies. O not invertiable</li>

<li><p>
You can also think about vector spaces of functions.
</p>

<p>
The line of functions y = ce<sup>x</sup> (for any c)  would be a "line in function space"
That line contains all the solutions to the differential equation dy/dx = y.
</p>

<p>
Another function space would be y=a+bx+cx<sup>2</sup>, solutions to d<sup>3</sup>/dy<sup>3</sup> = 0.
</p>

<p>
Linear differential equations replace linear algebraic equaitons Ax=0 when we move into function space.
</p></li>

<li>In some way the space of all 3x3 matricies is essentially the same space as R<sup>9</sup>.
The space of function f(x) = a + bx + cx<sup>3</sup> is essentially the same as R<sup>3</sup></li>

<li>One of the most fundamental ideas in linear algebra: The plane going through 0 is a subspace of the full vector space R<sup>3</sup>.</li>

<li>Every subspace contains the zero vector. Planes that dont contain the origin fail this test.</li>

<li>The column space is crucial to the whole book: To solve Ax=b is to express b as a combination of the columns.
The right side b had to be in the column space produced by A, or Ax=b has no solution!</li>

<li>The row space of A is the column space C(A<sup>T</sup>) of the transpose matrix A<sup>T</sup>.</li>

<li>Bases for Function Spaces:
The space for y'' = 0 has x and 1 as bases. It is the "nullspace" of the second derivative!
The solutions of y'' = 2 dont form a subspace- the right side is not zero.
A particular solution is y(x) = x<sup>2</sup>. The complete solution is y(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + cx +d.
All those functions satisfy y''=2. The particular solution plus any fucntion cx+d is in the nullspace.
A linear differential equation is like a linear matrix equation Ax=b.</li>

<li>A matrix multiplies a vector: A times x.
At the first level this is only numbers.
The second level Ax is a combination of column vectors
The third level shows subspaces. The fundamental subspaces are orthogonal.</li>

<li><p>
Key idea projections: If b is outside the column space of A, find the closest point p that is inside.
The line from b to p shows th error e. That line is perpendicular to the column space.
</p>

<p>
The key to projection is orthogonality: The line from b to p is perpendicular to the vector a.
</p></li>

<li>Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra:
N(A) is the orthogonal complement of the row space C(A<sup>T</sup>)
N(A<sup>T</sup>) is the orthogonal complement of the column space C(A)</li>

<li>Figure on 146!!!</li>

<li>Every vector Ax is in the column space! Multiplying by A cannot do anything else.
Every vector b in the column space comes from exactly one vector x<sub>r</sub> in the row space.</li>

<li>There is an r by r invertible matrix hiding inside A, if we throw away the two nullspaces, A is invertible from row space to column space.</li>

<li>When P projects onto one subspace, I-P projects onto the perpendicular subspace.</li>

<li>A<sup>T</sup> A is invertible if and only if A has linearly independent columns.</li>

<li>Fitting points by the best parabola is still a problem in linear algebra.</li>

<li>Fourier series is least squares in infinite dimensions &#x2013; approximating functions instead of vectors.
The function to be minimized changes from a sum of squared errors to an integral of the squared error.</li>

<li>Reflection: If u is any unit vector: Q = I - 2 u u<sup>t</sup> is a reflection. they are symmetric and orthogonal.</li>

<li>The one and only idea of the Gram-Schmidt process: Subtract from every new vector its projections in teh directions already set.</li>

<li>Any m x n matrix A with independent columns can be factored into A=QR. The m x n matrix Q has orthonormal columns, and the square matrix R is upper triangular with positive diagonal.</li>

<li><p>
Two vectors x and X in teh row space cannot go to the same vector Ax=AX in the column space.
Every vector b = Ax in the column space comes from one and only one vector x in the row space.
</p>

<p>
Suppose the vectors x1 to xr are a basis for the row space of A. Then the vectors Ax1 to Axr are a basis for the column space of A.
</p></li>

<li>Singular vectors of A are orthogonal unit vectors v1 to vr in the row space and Av1 to Avr are orthogonal in the column space. Perfection in applied linear algebra!</li>

<li>Every A in invertible from its row space to its column space: dimension r to r.</li>

<li>The determinant of a square matrix is an astonishing number</li>

<li>There are three useful formulas for det A.
The product of pivots in U gives det A or - det A.
The i,j entry of A<sup>-1</sup> is the j,i cofactor divided by detA
The big formula for det A adds up n! terms &#x2013; one for every path down the matrix. Each path chooses one entry from every row and column, and we multiply the n entries on the path.</li>

<li>Determinants could tell us everything, if only they were not so hard to compute.</li>

<li>Determinants reverse sign when two rows are exchanged (or two columns are exchanged). This rule becomes a key to dterminants of all sizes.</li>

<li>The most powerful property of the determinant is that is is linear in each row separately. The terms in teh calculation of the determinant have one entry from each row and one entry from each column.</li>

<li>If you do more algebra, then you need less geometry.</li>

<li>Eigenvectors and eigenvalues have new information about a square matrix &#x2013; deeper than its rank or column space.</li>

<li>A symmetric matrix S has perpendicular eigenvectors &#x2013; and all its eigenvalues are real numbers. The kings of linear algebra are symmetric matrices with positive eigenvalues.
These "positive definite matrices" signal a minimum point for a function like the energy f(x) = 1/2 x<sup>T</sup> S x. That is the n-dimensional form of the calculus test d2f/dx2 &gt; 0 for a minimum of f(x).</li>

<li>For du/dt = Au we want "eigenvectors" x that dont change direction when you multiply by A.  The solution vector u(t) stays in the direction of that fixed vector x. Then we only look for the number (changing with time) that multiples x: a one dimensional problem.</li>

<li>Markov matrix: each column adds to one. The largest eigen value is 1, the coorisponding eigenvector is a steady state- - which all columns of A<sup>k</sup> will approach.</li>

<li>If A is singular , the eigenvectors for &lambda;=0 fill the nullspace: Ax=0x=0. If A is invertible, zero is not an eigenvalue.</li>

<li>The product of the n eigenvales equals the dterminant of A.
The sum of the n eigenvales equals the trace of A</li>

<li>A symmetric matrix S<sup>T</sup>=S can be compared to a real number. A skew-symmetric matric (A<sup>T</sup> = -A) can be compared to an imaginary number.
An orthogonal matrix Q<sup>T</sup> Q = 1 corresponds to a complex number with |\lamba | = 1</li>

<li>Every matrix C = B<sup>-1</sup> A B has the same eigenvalues as A. C is "similar" to A.</li>

<li>When x is an eigenvector multiplication by A is just multiplication by a number. All the difficulties of matricies are swept away, and we can follow the eigenvalues seperately.</li>

<li>There is no connection between invertibility and diagonalizability
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Invertibility is concerned with the eigenvalues (we must have &lambda; != 0)</li>
<li>Diagonalizability is concerned with teh eigenvectors (n independent xs)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>AB and BA have the same nonzero eigenvales</li>

<li>When a complex number is transposed, replace each entry with its complex conjugate.
Then complex matricies fit perfectly into linear algebra</li>

<li>IF Ax = \lambba x then u(t) will solve du/dt= Au. Each \lambba and x give a solution e<sup>\lambba t</sup> x</li>

<li>Constant coefficient differential equations can be converted into linear algebra.</li>

<li><p>
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applies to every matrix, square or rectangular. It is an extention of eigenvectors.
But now we need two sets of orthonormal vectors: input vectors v1 to vn and output vectors ui to um.
This is completely natural for an m-x-n matrix. The vectors v<sub>i</sub> are a basis for the row space; u<sub>i</sub> for the column space.
</p>

<p>
A=USV<sup>T</sup>
</p>

<p>
The right singular vectors vi are eigenvectors of A<sup>TA</sup>. They give a basis for the row and nullspace of A.
They left singular vectors ui are eigenvectors of AA<sup>T</sup>. They give a basis for the column space and left nullspace of A.
</p></li>

<li>Each u<sub>i</sub> = v<sub>i</sub> when A is a symmetric positive definite matrix S. Those singular vectors will eb the eigenvectors q<sub>i</sub>.</li>

<li>PCA is totally base on the singular vectors of the data matrix A.</li>

<li>The SVD allows wonderful projcts, by separating a photograph - matrix of pixels into its rank-one components. Each time you include one more piece, the picture becomes clearer.</li>

<li>"The bible" 4th edition of Golub-Van Loan</li>

<li>The closest rank k matrix to A is A<sub>k</sub> = sigma<sub>1</sub> u<sub>1</sub> v<sub>1</sub><sup>T</sup> + &#x2026; + sigma<sub>k</sub> u<sub>k</sub> v<sub>k</sub><sup>T</sup>. In statistics we are identifying the rank one pieces of A with largest variance.
This puts SVD at the center of data science.</li>

<li>The best line (in PCA) solves a problem in perpendicular least squares. This is also called orthogonal regression.
It is different from the standard least squares  fit to n data points, or the list squares solution to a linear system Ax=b.
That classical problem measures distances up and down to the best line. Our problem minimizes perpendicular distances.
The older problem leads to a linear equation:  A<sup>TA</sup> = A<sup>T</sup> b for the best x. Our problem leads to singular vectors u<sub>i</sub>, eigenvectors of AA<sup>T</sup></li>

<li>PCA is a way to understand n sample points in m-dimensional space &#x2013;  the data. The crucial connection to linear algebra is in the singular values and the left singular vectors u<sub>i</sub> of A.
Those come from the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of teh sample covariance matrix S=AA<sup>T</sup>/(n-1)</li>

<li><p>
The SVD is producing orthogonal singular vectors u<sub>i</sub> that separate the data into uncorrelated pieces (with zero covariance). They come in order of decreasing variance, and the first pieces tell us what we need to know.
The trace of S connections the total variance to the sum of cariances of the priciple components.
</p>

<p>
Total variance T= sigma<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + &#x2026; sigma<sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>
The first princple component accounts for (or "explains") a fraction sigma<sup>2</sup>/T of the total variance.
Each singular vector is doing its best to capture the meaning in a matrix &#x2013; and all together they succeed.
</p></li>

<li>k signular vectors (acting together) explain more of the data than any other set of k vectors.</li>

<li>The "effective rank" of A and S is the number of singular values above the point where noise drowns the true signal in the data.</li>

<li>The Legendre polynomials are the result of applying the Gram-Schmidt idea, they orthogonalize the powers 1, x, x<sup>2</sup> &#x2026;</li>

<li>Newtons methond is fast near the true solution, because it uses the second derivatives of F(x). But those can be too expensive to compute &#x2014; esp in high dimension.
Often Neural networks are simply too large to use all the second derivatives of F(x). Gradient descent is the algorithm of choice for deep learning.</li>

<li>In gradient decent when the minimum valley is narrow, we uselessly cross the valley instead of moving down to the bottom.
This zig-zag would not happen for a heavy ball roling downhill. Its momentum carries it through the narrow valley &#x2013; bumping the sides but moving mostly forward.
So we add momentum with coefficient &beta; to teh gradient. This gives one of the most convenient and potentially useful ideas in deep learning.</li>

<li>Interpolation is an old problem. Deep learnign is a new approach &#x2013; much more successful than past approaches.
One of the worst approaches is to fit the data by a very high degree polynomial (The result is extremely unstable)</li>

<li>In deep learning the data-fitting computations are often heavily underdetermined. The art of deep learning is to find, among the many possible solutions, one that will generalize to new data.</li>

<li><p>
Deep Learning: Linearity is far too limited.  Artistically, two zeros could make an 8. Images don't add.
</p>

<p>
The non-linear choice that has succeeded beyond expectation &#x2013; and has turning shallow learning into deep learning &#x2013; is continuous piecewise linear fucntions.
Linear for simplicity, continuous to madel an unknown but reasonable rule, and piecewise to achieve the non-linearity that is an absolute requirement for real data.
</p></li>

<li>The best way to create complex functions from simple functions is by composition. (Ala wolfram)</li>

<li>The graph of the learning function is a surface made up of many many flat pieces &#x2013; they are place or hyperplanes that fit together along all the folds where the RuLU gives a change of slope.</li>

<li>It is easy to count entries in the weight matrices and the bias vectors. Those numbers determine the function F.
But it is farmore interesting to count the number of flat pieces in the graph of F.  This number measures the expressivity of the neural network.</li>

<li>One big lesson of deep learning: Dont code every grammatical rule and exception. Let the computer discover the rules. If you are teaching your friend a game, just start to play.</li>
