<h1 class="title">Modules Summary July 2025</h1>
<p>
CMU has made a first run of modules with the new tooling. Four CuT+v3b+preseries Si have been made using the new 4-modules-run procedure. The mechanical assembly looks good (installation grade A), but the electrical performance is not as expected. We are following up to see if it's a problem with the preseries Si or an issue with the new tooling. 130 Hexaboards (v3c) have been received from CERN and are being tested. So far ~50 have been tested and all look good. We have also recently received 21 Ti baseplates. We will continue to burn-in the new tooling with the v3b+CuT modules before doing a run of Ti+v3c.

For UCSB, Lincoln Satterthwaite is replacing Susanne who has retired; she will be missed! UCSB is struggling with receiving international shipments, a shipment of hexaboards and baseplates are stuck in customs. No modules have been produced in July. Currently investigating how to clear these and avoid in the future. They have begun a series of thermal cycling and coldbox studies and are waiting to hire additional personnel until fall when more actively ramping-up.
