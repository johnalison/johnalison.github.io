<p>
CMU has produced the first v3c Ti modules!  Fifteen modules where produced and 14/15 are high quality (one has ohmic IV curve). Half of them are being sent to the Cassette Assembly Facility in Fermilab and the rest will remain in CMU for testing. CMU has now received all of the final tooling.  It has been assembled and installed and is in the process of being commissioned. This will allow us to proceed at a cadence of four modules per day in May. We have hired a new technician who will start May 1st.
