<h1 class="title">Why Now is interesting</h1>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Multi-Planetary Species</li>
<li>AI revolutions</li>
<li>Brain-Machine Interface</li>
<li>Longevity</li>
<li>Ability to kill all of humanity (nukes / bio)</li>
<li>Genetic Re-engineering</li>
<li>Close to last generation that uses sex to reproduce</li>
<li>The precipice:
&gt; Claim that we now possess the ability to destroy ourselves without the wisdom to avoid doing so.
&gt; =&gt; high probability this will happen.
&gt; If we can avoid total destruction in next couple 100 years, we will have  the ability to "live forever"</li>
<li>Now the principles of Darwinian evolution are evolving.
&gt; conception through sex disappearing</li>
<li>We are living through a revolution: Information revolution. We have internalize it so dont think about it so much. With our current political situation: Could we be "paying the tab" for all the great 2\</li>
</ul>
<p>
1st century tech? This information age revolution is different because a core principle is the perpetually accelerating innovation. Society does not have time to "catch up" with the new world order and a\
dapt.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles woul\</li>
</ul>
<p>
d be over. Now we are choking in truth. (Denial of Death)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scientific revolution may well end history and start somethign different (Reason that now is different)</li>
<li>These days every year is revolutionary. Today, even a thiry-year old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers "When I was young, the was completely different"</li>
<li>Ours is the first time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite - politicians, business people, intellectuals and artists which genuinely see war as both evil and avoidable.</li>
<li>Homo sapiens are transcending biologically determined limits. It is now beginning to break the laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design</li>
<li>For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating to little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are\
killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.</li>
