<h1 class="title">CMU MAC Safety Incident</h1>
<p>
 At around 12 PM Eastern at the CMS Module Assembly Center, in the
process of Module Assembly on the pick and place gantry, the gantry
head impacted a technician's hands due to the malfunction of the
Emergency Stop (E-stop) button and failure to use the existing virtual
E-stops. The technician is in good health but was taken to the ER to
eliminate the possibility of a hairline fracture. The root cause of
the incident is a malfunctioning E-stop. Going forward, a standard
operating procedure will be added to test the E-stop daily and a
lock-out routine will be added to the controlling software such that
the gantry robot cannot be operated without a functional E-stop. The
source of the E-stop malfunction is currently being investigated.
