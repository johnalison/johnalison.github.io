Current Cost Variance:
-189k
</p>

<p>
The current cost variance of -$190k in cost account 402.04.04.04 (CE - Standard Module Assembly, Site 2 - CMU) is due to the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables. The submitted accruals reflect a lump sum covering several months of module assembly labor and consumables. These charges were submitted now to catch up with expenses that could only recently be allocated to the relevant cost account, resulting in the current cost variance.

Cumulative Schedule VAriance
-361k
</p>

<p>
There is a schedule variance of -$361k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 16% of modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts (hexaboards and baseplates). We now received 130 v3c hexaboards and 20 Ti baseplates. The final gantry tooling is currently being commissioned with v3b + CuT modules, we will then proceed to making a run of 20 Ti+v3c modules at a pace of four modules per day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb9b3dce">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the components become available, the value will be earned, and it should not impact the overall schedule.

<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$483k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$509k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-16%); the remainder is for supporting production at other assembly sites.
Baseplate had hexaboards have been shipped to UCSB. They are currently struggle with clearing customs, once this is sorted, module production will continue.
