<li>Good book overall. Could have been a lot shorter. too many examples / too much bragging / I think the idea. Would be interesting to try to implement</li>

<li>Only problem with Gantt charts: they are always wrong.</li>

<li>Gantt charts used to plan WWI (developed just prior)</li>

<li>Main idea: Whenever you start a project why not regularly check in to see if heading in the right direction/is actually what people want.</li>

<li>80% of the value of any piece of software in 20% of the features. <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>People &gt; process / Products that work &gt; documenting specs / Collaborating &gt; negotiating / responding to change &gt; following a plan</li>

<li>Three daily questions: What did you do since last meeting ? What are you going to do next ? What is getting in your way ?</li>

<li>That very large groups do LESS seems to be an iron clad rule of human nature.</li>

<li>Changing TEAM performance much more important (by orders of magnitude) than changing individual performance. <a href="Rationality.html#ID-E4DEB720-88F3-4E98-A7DF-175A32B68648">Rationality</a> <a href="Leadership.html#ID-984C9BFB-26B4-46E4-BA8F-593E79E777CD">Leadership</a></li>

<li>Dont look for bad people, look for bad systems - one that incentivize bad behaviors and reward poor performance <a href="Rationality.html#ID-E4DEB720-88F3-4E98-A7DF-175A32B68648">Rationality</a></li>

<li>Time makes up your life, wasting it is a form of suicide.</li>

<li>A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it should.</li>

<li>Normal Project Management Planning is stupid because people are so bad at predicting how much work something requires.</li>

<li>Key to refine they plan THROUGHOUT they project, rather than do it all up front.</li>

<li>What is the little improvement that can be done right away that will make things better?</li>

<li>He who will defend everything, defends nothing.</li>
