<li>Decent. Read the whole thing. Some good concepts. Lite in places. Lots of duplication.</li>

<li>Our basic thesis &#x2013; that we are strategically blind to key aspects of our motives &#x2013; has been around in some form or another for millennia. Any yet this thesis still seems to us neglected in scholarly writings; you can read a mountain of books and still miss it.</li>

<li>"Elephant in the Brain" - An important but unacknowledged feature of how our minds work; an introspective taboo.</li>

<li>Large randomized studies find that people given free health care consume a lot more medicine, yet dont end up noticeably healthier. Non-medical interventions such as efforts to alleviate stress or improve diet, exercise, sleep, or air quality &#x2013; have a much bigger apparent effect on health, and yet patients and policymakers are far less eager to purse them.  Patients are else easily satisfied with the appearance of good medical care.</li>

<li>Were suggesting that key human behaviors are often driven by multiple motives &#x2013; even behaviors that seem pretty single-minded, like giving and receiving medical care. More importantly, were suggesting that some of these motives are unconscious.</li>

<li>Human beings are a species that not only capable of acting on hidden motives, were designed to do it. Our brains are built to act in our self-interest while at the same time trying hard not to appear selfish in front of other people. And in order to throw them off the trail, our brain keep "us", our conscious minds, in the dark. The less we know of our own ugly motives, the easier it is to hide them from others. Self-deception is strategic, a ploy our brain's use to look good while behaving badly.  The human brain was designed to deceive itself, the better to deceive others.</li>

<li>Aim of the book: not just to catalog the many ways human behave unwittingly, but also to suggest that many of our most venerated institutions &#x2013; charities, corporations, hospitals, universities &#x2013; serve covert agendas alongside their official ones. We must take these covert agendas into account when thinking about these institutions, or risk radically misunderstanding them.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Human species are strategically self-deceived, not only as individuals, but also as a society.</li>

<li>We act on hidden motives together, in public, just as often as we do by ourselves in private. When enough of our hidden motives harmonize, we end up constructing stable, long-lived institutions &#x2013; schools, hospitals, churches, and democracies &#x2013; that are designed, at least in part, to accommodate such motives.</li>

<li>Education isn't just about learning; its largely about getting graded, ranked, and credentialed, stamped for the approval of employers.</li>

<li>A practical use for the book is to help readers develop better situational awareness.</li>

<li>Knowledge suppression is useful when two conditions are met:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>others have partial visibility into your mind</li>
<li>they are judging you, and meting out rewards or punishments based on what they "see" in your mind.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Just as camouflage is useful when facing ad adversary with eyes, self-deception is useful when facing an adversary with mind-reading powers.</li>

<li>Many signs suggest the keys to our intelligence lie in the harsh, unflattering light of social challenges, the arena of zero-sum games.</li>

<li>Like the redwood we weren't competing primarily against other species, but against ourselves.</li>

<li>Form the perspective of evolution, mating, not survival, is the name of the game.</li>

<li>The acts of judging and being judges are mediated by signals. Signals are said to be honest when they reliably correspond to an underlying trait or fact about the sender.  Deception allows an agent to reap benefits without incurring costs.</li>

<li>Note that we dont always need to be conscious of the signal were sending and receiving.</li>

<li>The deeper logic of many of our strangest and most unique behaviors may lie in their value as signals.</li>

<li>Once weapons enter the picture, physical strength is no longer the most crucial factor in determining a hominids success within a group. Political skill takes over as the determining factor.</li>

<li>Our mental processes act in bad faith, perverting or degrading our picture of the world.</li>

<li>Two schools of thought on why we deceive ourselves
-) 1st treats self-deception as a defense mechanism
-) 2nd treats self-deception as manipulation</li>

<li>In a variety of scenarios, limiting or sabotaging yourself is the winning move.
There is no value in sabotaging yourself per se. The value lies in convincing other players that you've sabotaged yourself.
Sabotaging yourself works only when you're playing against an opponent with a theory of mind</li>

<li>Usually we dont have to bear the full brunt of our own deception.  Typically, at least part of our brain continues to know the truth. Our saving grace is inconsistency.</li>

<li>Modularity: instead of a single monolithic process or small committee, modern psychologists see the brain as a patchwork of hundreds or thousands of different parts or "modules", each responsible for a slightly different information-processing task. (Probably needed given the constraints of evolution)</li>

<li>Its possible for our brains to maintain a relatively accurate set of beliefs in systems tasked with evaluating potential actions, while keeping those accurate beliefs hidden from the systems (like consciousness) involved in managing social impressions.</li>

<li>Its not that we are entirely or irredeemable selfish and self-deceived &#x2013; just that we're often rewarded for acting on selfish impulses, but less so for acknowledging them, and that our brain's respond predictably to those incentives.</li>

<li>Were strategically ignorant about our own motives.</li>

<li>Human brains contain a system you can call the "interpreter module" which makes sense of our experiences by constructing explanations.</li>

<li>Press secretaries and public relation teams exist in the world because they're incredibly useful to the organizations that employ them. They're a natural response to the mixed-motive incentives that organizations face with their broader ecosystems. Our brains respond to the same incentives by developing a module analogous to a president's press secretary.  Above all, the job of our brain's Press Secretary is to avoid acknowledging our darker motives.</li>

<li>This is the key slight-of-hand at the heart of our psychosocial problems: We pretend we're in charge, both to others and even to ourselves, but we're less in charge than we think.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In many ways we seem to prefer it this way; we feel it is appropriate for people to act spontaneously</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Humans are strategically blind to body language because it often betrays our ugly, selfish, competitive motives.</li>

<li>In spoken language, the mapping between symbols and meanings is mostly arbitrary. Body language, however is mostly not arbitrary.</li>

<li>body language isn't just a way to communicate. Its also functional; it has material consequences. Body language is inherently more honest than verbal language.</li>

<li>When people disagree about their relative status, nonverbal coordination breaks down.</li>

<li>The magic of nonverbal communication is that it allows us to pursue illicit agendas, even ones that require coordinating with other people, while minimizing the risk of being attacked, accused, gossiped about, and censured for norm violations. This is one of the reasons we're strategically unaware of our own body language, and its helps explain why we're reluctant to teach it to children.</li>
