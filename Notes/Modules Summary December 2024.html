<p>
The ordering of assembly tooling is well underway; the first batch of tools have been checked and shipped to CMU and TTU. The remaining orders have been placed.  
</p>

<p>
15 Ti full baseplates (12 HD) have been shipped to UCSB. The preproduction at UCSB will start once these are in hand.  UCSB has also been following up on the recent site visits. This has allowed the US MACs to synchronize methods, share best practices, and plan the specifics of ramping-up.
</p>

<p>
CMU has started pre-production! We will assemble 8 modules LD CuT modules. 34 more baseplates are on the way which will allow production to continue in the new year. The first round of the final tooling has arrived at CMU and the chiller is arriving this week.  We have hired two technicians to start in new year and have an ad out for a third.
