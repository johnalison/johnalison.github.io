<li>Good book, could use modern translator.</li>

<li>If you realize that only that you only own what you can control
No man will hinder you, you will never blame any man, and do nothing against your will.</li>

<li>You should not want things to happen as you wish, but to wish that things happen as they do.</li>

<li>For every accident that happens, inquire what power you have for turning it into use.</li>

<li>It is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy.</li>

<li>Let death and exile and every other thing which appears dreadful be daily before your eyes, most of all death, and you will never think of anything mean or desire anything extravagantly.</li>

<li>When you are about to do something pleasure-able, wait.
Think about the time you will spend enjoying the pleasure and the time after.
If after reflecting on both times, it seems sensible to do the thing, then enjoy it.</li>

<li>Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be used and the other by which it may not.</li>

<li><p>
On no occasion call yourself of a philosopher, and do not speak much among the uninstructed about theorems, but do that which follows form them.
(at a banquet dont say how a man ought to eat, but eat as you ought to.) <a href="BeTheGood - Intelligent ACTION is power.html#ID-C89C3614-ED48-4608-B02D-E398E64F328B">BeTheGood - Intelligent ACTION is power</a>
</p>

<p>
If a philosophical discussion should arise among uninstructed persons, generally be silent.
There is great danger that you will immediately vomit up what you have not digested.
For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally digested the pasture, they produce wool and milk.
Do not show your philosophy to the uninstructed, but show the acts which come from their digestion.
</p></li>

<li>It is better to do wrong seldom and own it, and to act right for the most part, than seldom to admit that you have done wrong and do to wrong often.</li>

<li>If you wish to be well spoken of, learn to speak well of others.
When you have learned to speak well of them try to act well, and you will reap the fruit of being well spoken of.</li>

<li>When we have been invited to dinner, we take what is served.
If a guest should ask for that which is not served, he would be considered unreasonable.
But in the world we ask the Gods for what they do not give; and we do this though the things are many which they have given.
<a href="Advice.html#ID-09933F9D-D438-4D28-911B-B46DCEEE9BC4">Advice</a></li>

<li>Do you wish to be rich or happy?
To be rich is neither a good thing nor at all in your power.
To be happy is both a good thing and in your power.</li>

<li>If you had been Persian you would not have wished to live in Greece, but to live happily in Persia.
So if you are born in poverty, why do you seek to grow rich? Why not remain in poverty and be happy?</li>

<li>It is not poverty which produces sorrow, but desire; nor does wealth release from fear, but reason.</li>

<li>At parties you entertain two guests, body and soul: and whatever you shall give to the body will be soon ejected, but what you shall give the soul you will always keep.</li>

<li>What we ought not to do, we should not even think of doing.</li>

<li>Think a lot before saying or doing anything, for you will not have the power of recalling what has been said or done.</li>

<li>Listen to those who wish to advise what is useful, but not to those who are eager to flatter on all occasions.
The first really see what is useful, the second look to that which agrees with the opinion of those who posses power.</li>

<li>Choose to punish your appetites rather than to be punished by them.</li>

<li>Do not grieve for the things you don't have, but rejoice for those that you do.</li>
