Dear Colleagues  
</p>

<p>
I am writing to strongly support Chuyuan Liu's application for a
postdoctoral fellowship at Cornell. Chuyuan is determined and
independent and exceptionally talented. He is a skilled and creative
programmer &#x2014; easily the strongest technical member we have at CMU,
student or postdoc. He has demonstrated the ability to design and
implement modern machine learning architectures, to develop
technically demanding codebases, and to independently execute complex
analyses. His level of initiative and intellectual depth makes him an
outstanding candidate for this position.
</p>

<p>
My group focuses on searches for new physics with di-Higgs (HH)
production in the 4b final state. Chuyuan has been deeply involved in
4b analyses since joining in 2020. This channel is particularly
challenging: it suffers from a combinatorial problem in b-jet
assignment when forming Higgs boson candidates, and it faces large,
hard-to-model backgrounds from QCD multi-jet production.
</p>


<p>
<b>ZZ/ZH -&gt; 4b</b>
</p>

<p>
When Chuyuan joined, my group had just begun exploring solutions to
these problems. He was the only graduate student on the effort,
working alongside postdoc Patrick Bryant and myself. Our plan was to
develop and test strategies in the ZZ/ZH → 4b analysis and later apply
them to HH → 4b. As a junior graduate student, Chuyuan quickly began
making important contributions—and he has not stopped since.
</p>

<p>
To address the combinatorics of b-jet pairing, we developed a custom
classifier architecture for the 4b final state that simultaneously
processes all jet pairings. This was a major learning exercise for my
group both technically—mastering state-of-the-art ML tools—and
scientifically, as it improved our understanding of the structure of
the problem. For example, we learned it is a mistake to identify a
single “best” jet pairing: the pairing optimal for reconstructing
signal events is often sub-optimal for rejecting background.
Ultimately, we built a model analogous to a graph neural network with
an attention mechanism to combine information from all pairings. This
network became the workhorse of the ZZ/ZH → 4b analysis. It was used
to define the final discriminating variable, and to derive the
background model and associated systematic uncertainties Chuyuan
played a critical role in every aspect of its development, from
initial prototyping to optimizing the user interface to allow the
network to be adapted to other analyses.
</p>

<p>
The second major challenge in the 4b analysis is assessing systematic
uncertainties on the data-driven multijet background. The QCD
background is determined in a signal-free control region using a
variant of the ABCD method, The background prediction in the signal
region requires an extrapolation that is a significant source of
systematic uncertainty. Conventional approaches for assessing this
extrapolation uncertainty validate the background prediction in a
third, statistically independent validation region. This strategy can
address how accurately the background model extrapolates to a
different region of phase space, but does not directly test the
extrapolation into the signal region. In addition, it necessarily
suffers from a lack of statistical power in the phase space with the
highest signal-to-background ratio; the selection that makes the
validation region background-dominated depletes the most sensitive
phase space.
</p>


<p>
To overcome this, we introduced a new method using synthetic datasets
obtained through hemisphere mixing. These datasets serve as
high-fidelity proxies of the 4b background, enabling validation of
extrapolations directly in the relevant phase space. Once again,
Chuyuan was deeply involved in developing this technique—from
debugging early implementations to deriving final systematic
uncertainties from observed non-closure.
</p>

<p>
This work was published in European Physical Journal C, with Chuyuan
as the only contributing student.
</p>


<p>
<b>Fully Hadronic VHH -&gt; 4b</b>
</p>

<p>
Once the major pieces of the ZZ/ZH analysis were in place, Chuyuan
approached me about extending our effort to VHH production in the
fully-hadronic jj+4b final state. I was excited to see his initiative,
but was initially hesitant. <i>Would he really have time to see this and
the ZZ/ZH analysis through?</i> <i>Won't the sensitivity be dominated by
the leptonic V decays?</i> In the end, Chuyuan did the work to convince
me that this was worth pursuing, but I made him aware that he would
largely be on his own.
</p>


<p>
Chuyuan sought out collaboration with Chris Palmer and Chyanit
Asawatangtrakuldee. Chris and Chyanit's groups would cover the
leptonic V decay modes and Chuyuan was to be responsible for the
fully-hadronic final state. Chuyuan then independently ported our
improvements to this more challenging final state; he adapted the
graph network to also handle V-&gt;jj decays and validated the synthetic
dataset in the more complex final state. I followed his work and gave
him some high-level advice, but Chuyuan led and executed the
analysis.
</p>

<p>
The result was a major success. It was the first VHH result published
in this final state~\cite{2}. The fully hadronic channel proved to be among the
most sensitive, and Chuyuan was honored to be the first to present the result publicly
for at a conference.
</p>


<p>
<b>Code development</b>
</p>

<p>
The ZZ/ZH and VHH analyses were originally carried out in a C++
framework. Before tackling HH → 4b, Chuyuan pushed our group to
migrate to a coffea/Python-based framework. This migration required
new reproducibility tools and yielded major performance gains:
workflows that previously took an hour and ~200 Condor jobs in C++ now
run locally on a single LPC node in just 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Chuyuan also led the adoption of modern software practices—continuous
integration, unit testing, and systematic result replication. Today,
our codebase runs over 30 integration checks for every merge request,
from unit tests of base functions to end-to-end tests of the full
analysis pipeline. Here again, I was initially reluctant to invest in
this infrastructure, but it has transformed our productivity and
collaboration. Thanks to Chuyuan’s leadership, our software is more
robust, our group more efficient, and our students better prepared for
careers both within and beyond HEP.
</p>



<p>
<b>HH-&gt;4b</b>
</p>

<p>
We are now analyzing HH → 4b, applying the tools first developed for
ZZ/ZH and extended by Chuyuan in VHH. Our group is part of the
CMS-wide effort and is responsible for the Run-2 dataset. Our methods
have been adopted as the baseline strategy for the combined Run-2 +
Run-3 analysis. Chuyuan is once again playing a key role in advancing
this result, which is currently undergoing CMS review. A draft for
submission to Physical Review D is expected later this year.
</p>


<p>
In summary, Chuyuan has tackled some of the hardest problems in the 4b
final state, developed novel solutions, and seen them through to
published physics results. He has repeatedly extended these ideas into
new contexts, taken intellectual risks, and executed them at a high
level. Within my group, he already operates at the level of a postdoc.
I give him my strongest possible recommendation for the Cornell
fellowship.
