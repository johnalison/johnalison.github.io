<li>Poor Richard: Neglect kills injuries, Revenge increases them</li>

<li>Need more forgiveness
&gt; forgiveness is transcendence (transcends human nature).
&gt; Good for mind.  Good for future self.</li>

<li>"We are bad men living among bad men, one thing that can calm us down is to be easy on each other" - William Irvine</li>

<li>Ask your people "What do you need to get your job done?" Then go out and get that.</li>

<li>Most important thing to learn is: We have so much to learn.  Realize this and open your mind.</li>

<li>You should invite some to your table because they deserve it, other because they may come to deserve it.</li>

<li>Being a person who always knows (or think you do) everything is actually a form of stupidity and misery.
(Not a path to wisdom)</li>

<li>Be spotless. A single cloud can hide the whole of the sun. (Baltasar Gracian)</li>

<li>Search others for their virtues, yourself for you vices. (Poor Richards Almanac)</li>

<li>It is easy for indignation to be eloquent but hard for it to be fair; no moralist should write history. (Caesar And Christ)</li>
