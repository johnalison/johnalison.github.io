<p>
Not sure how meaningful large theory uncertianties are on the observed
mu. Especially in cases where sensitivity to the SM is low (5-8x SM).
In these case, the fitted mu can get be large (even though consistent
with 0). The size of the theory uncertianties scale with the observed
mu. In cases where the relative SM theory uncertianties are large,
theory uncertianties can become the leading uncertianty on mu. The
observed limit then is largely driven by the uncertianty on the
reference cross section used to normalizie the observed value, not the
excess observed.

<p>
<b>Other Points:</b>
This is reallly an exotics analysis, In  EXO, we would never be including these
uncertianties on observed limits.
</p>

<p>
Its also, not clear that they are only really valid for mu = 1 anyway.
eg: does the effect of mTop really just scale linearly with with mu up to mu~10?
