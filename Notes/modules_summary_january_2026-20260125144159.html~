<h1 class="title">Modules Summary January 2026</h1>
<p>
At CMU we have demonstrated production using the 8 modules/day
protocol for 5 days and are now moving to 12 modules/day. We have made
44 modules in last month, all but two are high quality. The MMTS
stetup is ongoing. We believe we now have all the hardware and are
focusing on setting it the plumbing and hardware interlock. This is
now our highest priority.

UCSB has assembled 116 v3C or v3D modules at this point. We have
components for 8 more HD top v3D 120um, which are being finished this
week. From there will need parts, expecting more in February: 220 HD Full v3D
hexaboards. MMTS setup is ongoing. PLC software is uploaded to CPU, HMI
is operating with custom interface. We have performed several Themal cycle
campaigns of both partial and fulls. A few modules were also destroyed
to check for robustness, the results are promising.
