I read the play and a book of essays about the play. 
</p>

<p>
The play was entertaining, a lot went over my head.
The critique was a good companion, I will continue to do this with his other plays, but even some of these were over my head. 
</p>

<p>
Not sure how much I learned from MacBeth, seems like a lot of this was groundbreaking at the time but is now just baked in to our world view.
