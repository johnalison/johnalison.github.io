<p>
<b>Living room</b>
</p>

<p>
You enter into a warm, open living room with hardwood floors and an easy, loungey layout. A large leather sofa anchors the space, with extra seating (including a cozy reading chair) arranged around a decorative fireplace mantel and a wall-mounted smart TV—great for movie nights or catching a game. Track lighting keeps the room bright in the evenings, and the built-ins/bookshelves add a homey, lived-in feel. 
</p>

<p>
There’s also a small work/reading nook by the front window, which feels ideal for laptop time, journaling, or planning your day in the city.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dining room</b>
</p>

<p>
Just off the living area is a separate dining space that comfortably fits a full dining table (seating for a group)—perfect for shared meals, board games, or spreading out takeout from Walnut Street. The dining room also features classic details (including another fireplace feature) and stays connected to the rest of the first floor, so it feels social rather than closed-off.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Kitchen connection</b>
</p>

<p>
The dining room opens toward the kitchen, making it easy to cook and serve meals without feeling tucked away.  The modern kitchen features high-end appliances, including a spacious fridge, stove, microwave, and oven, along with an array of additional modern kitchen equipment. 
</p>

<p>
The kitchen leads out to a large deck,  perfect for unwinding and relaxing, enjoying delicious meals, and fostering meaningful conversations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Finished basement lounge</b>
</p>

<p>
Downstairs, the finished basement is set up like a second hangout room—a dedicated spot to unwind with the big-screen smart TV. It’s a great overflow space if part of your group wants to watch something while others talk upstairs, and it also works nicely as a quiet office/playroom-style flex space.  A half-bath is also located in the basement, ensuring easy access for you and your guests during your stay.
</p>

<p>
The basement includes a full washer and dryer for your ease.
</p>


<p>
<b>Bedrooms</b>
</p>

<p>
The home has 3 separate bedrooms, and each bedroom with queen bed.
	• Bedroom 1 (Queen): Bright and airy with two tall windows, a tempropedic mattress, and great storage (double-door closet + dresser/nightstand setup). 
   • Bedroom 2 (Queen): A cozy, design-forward room with a comfortable queen bed, an accent wall, and a relaxing chair by the window—nice for reading or winding down. 
  • Bedroom 3 (Queen): Simple, calm, and comfortable—ideal for guests who want a quiet night’s sleep and an uncluttered space. 
</p>

<p>
Each room has a spacious closet perfect for storing and organizing your belongings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bathroooms</b>
The bathrooms are stocked for your stay with fresh towels and starter essentials, so you can settle in right away. There’s also a convenient half bath for added ease when traveling with family or friends.
</p>

<p>
<b>Outdoor extension</b>
While the indoor living spaces are the main draw, guests also get bonus outdoor areas (covered front porch + private deck), which makes the home feel bigger.
</p>


<p>
<b>Parking:</b> Enjoy two free off-street parking spaces behind the building. While street parking is also available at no cost, it can become challenging to find, especially later in the day. For your convenience, there’s a nearby parking garage for overflow parking, just a short walk away.
</p>

<p>
<b>AC/ Heating</b>: There is central heating and air conditioning in the house
</p>

<p>
<b>Smart Lock</b>: The entrance of the house feature a smart lock, providing you with convenient access without the hassle of keys. A unique code will be automatically generated for you upon booking and will be included in your check-in instructions, allowing you to come and go as you please!
</p>

<p>
Please message me with any questions or concerns, my team and I will promptly get back to you 24/7 and are happy to chat. We look forward to hosting you and your family/ friends and providing you a true 5 star experience!
