My habits have all been good. I just finished another four-day fast,
feels so good. BJJ has been picking up. I got stripe and have been
doing a lot of the self defense courses. The kids are back to school
and I am slowly getting back into work. CMU started, I am teaching MPL
again. I only have 8 students, but will use it to learn some new
experiements, currently doing Raman Spectroscopy. I've Finished the
DOE renewal and have started looking into plain text accounting with
ledger. I've put in lots of work getting this into a reasonable initial
state and to figure out how to process csv files from the bank. Its
not clear if I want to do this long term, but I think its good seeing
what kind of tools are availible. On the reading front, Im starting to
get more into Shakespeare. I plan on using Blooms book to to go deep
here. Marlo had her fifth birthday. Im really proud of her she is
really coming along.

There has been some more progress on Steph's faculty position. She was
asked when she could start and to prepare her "wish list". She has now
formally applied for the position.

<p>
On the 4b side, I'm starting to push Chuyuan to get his thesis ready.
I need to write his letter.
</p>

<p>
I've started to get more into bbWW. Ive setup code and am going to try
to do something useful here.
</p>

<p>
There has been action on the HGC front. Arvind has arrived and we are
back to making working modules. Seems like somthing is amiss with 200um
Si and CuT baseplate&#x2026; to be followed up on. The MMTS setup is
proceeding.
