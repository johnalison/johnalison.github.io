<h1 class="title">Modules Summary August 2024</h1>
<p>
For modules it has generally been a slow month. Lots of people were away and there were no general MAC Meetings. 
</p>

<p>
UCSB has been planning site visits to TTU and CMU. These are now scheduled for end of October and will involve two full days at each MAC.
</p>

<p>
CMU has finished the finished pre-series modules. This month we built 6 additional modules (carbon fiber baseplates with hybrid gluing) all done using the two-at-a-time gantry assembly protocol. No dead half chips were observed.  We are currently studying the electrical performance of the modules. 
</p>

<p>
We have developed a GUI to interface the wirebonding QA/QC information to the DB. It has been prototyped at CMU and now being integrated at UCSB, we will then proceed to roll it out to other MACs. 
</p>

<p>
There has been progress on defining QA/QC databases tables. And we are testing local to global DB uploads.
</p>

<p>
CMU has also lost an electronics Eva engineer, who is moving back to Seattle.
