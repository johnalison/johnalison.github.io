<li>Excellent. Exactly up my alley.</li>

<li>Morality represents the way that people would like the world to work, whereas economics represents how the world really does work.</li>

<li>Incentives are the cornerstone to modern life. Understanding them is the key to understanding just about any riddle. <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Conventional wisdom often shoddily formed and devilishly difficult to see through.</li>

<li>Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle causes.</li>

<li>"Experts" use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However they can be beat at their own game.</li>

<li>Knowing what to measure and how to measure it, makes a complicate world much less so.</li>

<li>Any incentive is inherently a trade off. The trick is to balance the extremes.</li>

<li>So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and effects in this world that a 2 penny duty on tea unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it, changes the conditions of all its inhabitants,</li>

<li>April 15th 1987, at midnight 7 million American children suddenly disappeared. Cause: The IRS changed a rule. Instead of listing the name of the dependent children, you now also had to provide a SSN
(10% of all dependents vanished)</li>

<li>IF economics is a science primarily concerned with incentives, it is also a science of statistical tool to measure how people respond to those incentives.</li>

<li>Noticing where the conventional wisdom may be false - noticing perhaps the contrails of sloppy of self-interested thinking - is a nice place to start asking questions.</li>

<li>Romanian communist party rounded up women in their workplaces to administer pregnancy tests. If a women repeatedly failed to conceive she was forced to pay a "celibacy tax"  
Of all communist leaders deposed in the years around the Soviet collapse, only the Romanian lead met a violent death. (Claim: the unwanted children grew up to be violent)</li>

<li>To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is jarring.</li>
