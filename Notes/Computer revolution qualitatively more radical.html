<h1 class="title">Computer revolution qualitatively more radical</h1>
<p>
Computers are qualitatively different from the technological sources of previous historical revolutions (eg: books, the printing press, and radio) in that they can made decisions and create new ideas, including new inter-subjective realities, all on their own.  Historical revolutions radically change our information processing networks, typically by strengthening or changing the connections between human-agents nodes.  With computers, now have for the first time a change in the nodes themselves; computers can be active full-fledged agents in information processing networks. This is the first time there is participation in our inter-subjective reality (our culture) by an alien intelligence.
