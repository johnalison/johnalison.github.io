"I have rarely encountered a student as independent and determined as Wes. He has forged his own path in both analysis and hardware projects—something exceptionally rare for a graduate student. His thesis project uses the CMS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider to search for Dark Matter in ways it was not built for and which nobody 5 years ago would have thought possible. In addition to his thesis work, he moved to CERN to take a key role in developing an upgraded detector that will be used throughout the next decade."
