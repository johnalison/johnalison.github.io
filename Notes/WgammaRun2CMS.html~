Would be good to say a few senstances about how these are defined.

l303) Seems like this beam halo veto is new to this analyis.
      Might be nice to include a plot showing the rejection. (and the fit to phi)

-Section 10.1:
  Suprised to not see the jet-veto here.
  How much of the fiducial cross section comes from evetns that would fail the jet veto used in the measurement ?
