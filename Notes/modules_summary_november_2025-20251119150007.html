<p>
UCSB has made 26 v3C HD fulls last month. The HD full (CuW) assembly
 was performed using a 12 modules / day protocol and good placement
 and electrical properties where observed. They have performed a
 thermal cycling campaign where ~30 modules going through 100 thermal
 cycles. In parallel work is on going to setting up the multi-module
 test stand. The thermal chamber has been received and is being
 installed

<p>
CMU is still waiting for baseplates, a shippment as been sent from
CERN and should arring in time to resume module production in
December. During the downtime we have finalized the auto-loctate
functionality LabVIEW and have continued to setup the multi-module
test stand. We have installed the thermal chamber in the cleanroom
and are currently plumbing the coolant lines.
