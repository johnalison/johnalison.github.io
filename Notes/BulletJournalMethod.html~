<li>The more content you try to capture during a meeting the less your thinking about whats being said. You burn through most of you attention trying to parrot the source.</li>
<li>(re: meetings) Sit for a while and give yourself a moment to process what you heard</li>
<li>When making notes: keep your future self in mind.</li>
<li>For everything you say yes to, your saying no to something else. Yes means work, sacrifice, time, and opportunity cost.</li>
<li>Organization can become a cleverly disguised form of distraction.</li>
<li>"It is not daily increase, but daily decrease. Hack away the inessential" Bruce Lee</li>
<li>(re: social media) "Exploiting vulnerability in human psychology is the bread and butter of our economy" -founding member of facebook</li>
