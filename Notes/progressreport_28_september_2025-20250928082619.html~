My habits have been good. Exercise and reading have been very strong,
meditation can use some work. I'm almost done with classical physics
and modern economic principles. I think I will start on Feynman
Lectures next. I will probably keep it to only one textbook at a time.
</p>

<p>
On the social side I saw Patrick and his girl friend (&gt;2years). He is
doing well, Will start a new fully-remote job for a power grid
company. May move to Pittsburgh after lease is up in DC. I also did
hot pot with Tony, Clay and another guy. Good times, good convo.

I have been spending a lot of time thinking about crypto and how to
avoid selling. Micheal Andrews had a great suggestion (confirmed by
T-man) to borrow against my crypto. There is a deFi app called AAVE
which seems legit is essentially exactly for what I need for my
purposes. The loans are overcollatoralized, meaning you put in more
value of crypto than you take out in USD. I will do this with the rest
of the crypto I need for 5421. It has the nice befifit of avoiding
taxes. Given that the loans need to over collatoralized I probably
would not be able to take out more, even if I knew about this sooner.

Lot of teaching. For MPL, experiment 1 is done, I still need to grade
the write-ups, but its really all down hill from here. One lecture
left in the Osher course. I will give them a summary of HGC and lab
tour this week.
</p>

<p>
I've been doing a lot of reviewing: X-&gt;HY-&gt;4b / 3 tops (ARC) /
 bbtautau (thesis) X-&gt;ZZ (paper review) / 4b (still todo). Chyuan had
 an interview with cornell. Says it went smooth. Should get a follow
 up from Joey. Again, I am doing my part on the letters.
</p>

<p>
Lots of coordination on the 4b front. We will work with 4b resonant
team for Sindhu's analysis. Mauro will likely also join the FCB2 4b
working group.
</p>

<p>
I need to get back to programming. There are clear to do items in
bbWW, just need to find time to execute.
</p>

<p>
The HGC MMTS setup proceeding. Ive got a rack from Randy, just need to
clean it off and move it.
