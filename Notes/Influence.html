<li>Very good. Reads well, learned a lot</li>

<li>Six basic tactics to get compliance. Each governed by fundamental psychological principle that directs human behavior: <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a>
Consistency / Reciprocation / Social Proof / Authority / Liking / Scarcity <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>Well known principle of human behavior: when we ask someone to do us a favor will be more successful if we provide a reason. <a href="Munger.html#ID-22E1B4DC-0D97-4FBB-8D26-7692074652AD">Munger</a></li>

<li>As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow more intricate and variable we will have to depend increasingly on shortcuts to handle them all.</li>

<li>Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them. -Whitehead</li>

<li>Odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance most of us know very little about our own automatic behavior patterns.</li>

<li>Contrast Principle: If second item fairly different from 1st, we will tend to see it more differently than it actually is. <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>We are human b/c our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in a honored network of obligation.</li>

<li>Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule =&gt; they made sure their members are trained to comply and believe in it.</li>

<li>Desire to be and look consistent is a highly potent weapon of social influence often causing us to act in ways contrary to our best interest. <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>Social Proof: thinking short cut, find out what others think is correct (Also vulnerable to attack) <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a>
&gt; When we are unsure of ourselves, when there is uncertainty, we are most likely to look and to accept the actions of others as correct.
&gt; Fake applause at opera: "Claque" / "Chef de claque"</li>

<li>How to defend against authority : "Is this authority truly an expert ? " / "How trustful can we expect the expert to be here?" <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a> <a href="Rationality.html#ID-E4DEB720-88F3-4E98-A7DF-175A32B68648">Rationality</a></li>

<li>With all six of these principles we are usually and efficiently correct.</li>

<li>They fact that news conveying the fact that a product is going to be scarce is itself (the news) scarce makes it esp. persuasive.</li>

<li>Knowing these weapons of persuasion is often not enough. Knowing is a cognitive thing, cognitive processes are suppress by our emotional reactions to the different weapons.</li>
