<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Determinism is true by assumtion. Cerian axioms must be assumed to be able to purse knowledge via reason, those axioms are incompatible with detiminism</li>
</ul>

<p>
Seems like should is doing a lot of work
Could also quibble with "I believe I have free will. (empirical premise)"  (direct introspection, <a href="the_illusion_of_free_will_is_an_illusion-20260128172939.html#ID-D51BA769-3E9D-406A-A10E-0811DBD21C30">The illusion of free will is an illusion</a>
</p>

<p>
Meta argument: This argument holds in a world that is deterministic (assuming people think they have free will in this world).  
So the agrument proves determinism is false, whether or not it is in fact false.
</p>

<p>
What about including probabilites ? eg: What if there isa certian proabability that free will
</p>

<p>
Also seems premise 1 seems wronge "You should believe the truth".  Seems like we should only believe what we have rational evidence to support. (Incompleteness) 
Also doesnt this presuppose free will ? If determinism is true, what does it mean to say "you should you believe the true" will only do what you will do. Seems like the concept of should has no meaning. 
</p>


<p>
Step 5 "So if determinism is true, then we believe only the truth. (from 1, 4)"
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This arguement seems to show that you can have no false beliefs in determinsitic world&#x2026;
Clearly something has gone wrong.</li>
</ul>
