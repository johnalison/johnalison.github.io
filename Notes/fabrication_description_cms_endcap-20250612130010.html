<b>Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
The Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) High-Energy Physics (HEP) Group
with John Alison, Valentina Dutta, and Manfred Paulini studying
elementary particle physics currently as members of the CMS
Collaboration. The CMS detector is a large multi-purpose experiment
operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European
particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. Research with
the CMS experiment explores the fundamental constituents of matter and
has received high priority within the U.S. particle physics program as
supported by the Office of High Energy Physics at the U.S. Department
of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science, which is sponsoring this
research. CMU physicists have participated in the CMS experiment since
1994 and the CMS experiment is expected to continue operating at the
LHC with participation from CMU faculty for the next 20 years.
</p>

<p>
In the high-luminosity phase of the LHC physics program, the
accelerator is foreseen to provide an integrated luminosity of about
3000 fb−1 over 10 years of operation starting in 2030. As outlined in
the Technical Proposal for the Phase-II upgrade of the CMS detector,
several upgrades are planned to address the aging of the present
detector elements. One such element of the Phase-II upgrade is the
replacement of the current electromagnetic and hadronic endcap
calorimeters with a High Granularity Calorimeter (HGC) that has
electromagnetic and hadronic sections with excellent transverse and
longitudinal segmentation. The scope of the CMU work within the US-CMS
collaboration is the construction of all parts for the hadronic
section of the endcap calorimeter (CE-H). This work includes the
design and construction of the active detectors in the CE-H, which
will be integrated into two large scale devices (endcaps) whose total
cost is greater than $5M . The endcaps will be used for the duration
of the HL-LHC program, currently expected to run until 2041.

<b>Module Assembly at CMU</b>
</p>

<p>
Carnegie Mellon University has been chosen by the US-CMS upgrade
project as one of three U.S. Module Assembly Center for the CMS
Phase-II Endcap Calorimeter Upgrade together with UC Santa Barbara
(UCSB) and Texas Tech University (TTU). There are in addition three
international assembly sites in China, India, and Taiwan working on
the module assemble for the electromagnetic portion of the endcap
calorimeter.
</p>

<p>
The standard modules are the basic building blocks for the hadronic
section of the endcap calorimeter. A module consists of a base plate,
a sheet of kapton gold-plated on one side, a silicon sensor, and a
printed circuit board (PCB). Using a robotic device called a gantry,
these components are taped and epoxied together to form a solid stack
and the electrical connections between the PCB and the silicon sensor
are accomplished by wire bonding. The activities at the CMU Standard
Module Assembly Site consist of the assembly of about 5000
full-hexagon 192-channel modules, testing during the assembly process,
quality control (QC) at the end of production, and shipping of the
modules, in ESD-safe foam and boxes, to the cassette production site.
