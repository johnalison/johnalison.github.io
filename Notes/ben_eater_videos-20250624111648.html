Hi Hy,
Here are links to the tutorials I talked about.   These are very good and should be accessible highschool students.

</ul>
<p>
He has videos that expain whats going on and how to do the assembly which are very good.
He also has kits availbe from his website.
I did the the "build a 6502 computer" (<a href="https://eater.net/6502">https://eater.net/6502</a>) during COVID and learned a ton! I would recommend starting there.
