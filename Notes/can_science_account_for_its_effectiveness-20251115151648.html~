<p>
Science is always pulling itself up from its own bootstraps. We need
to posit some scientific axioms &#x2013; regularities that are assumed to
exist &#x2013; then we show that other observed regularities are explained
by these axioms. Of course it works in practice, but what explains the
success of this program? Presumably this can't be explained by science
alone.
