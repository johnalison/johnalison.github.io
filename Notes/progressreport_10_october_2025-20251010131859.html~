My habits have all been good, although the meditation is starting to
slip. Reading has been strong; I've finished an undergraduate book on
classical phyaics and have started the Feynman Lectures. Ive also been
reading a lot of shakespeare. Its still not clear how much I'm getting
out of it, but I will press on, maybe it is more of a slow burn. Ive
setup and been playing with AAVE. I plan to start with half the $200k
loan in the next few days. I will follow up with the other half once I
see that all is good. Ive had some success at BJJ, would like to focus
more on defense.

I will give experimental hot topics talk at HIggs couplings in brown.
Will be a nice chance to see people and I can probably reuse a lot of
my LHCP talk. Getting this "solved" will be the next big project.

On the 4b side, we had a big fight about what todo with the Run-2 VBF.
Because ~all the sensitivity is driven by Run-3, we will not included
the old dedicated Run2 VBF channel. It is a little surprising that the
Run2 results (both Resolved and Boosted) are so weak compared to Run3.
For ggF the Run2 is somewhat stronger&#x2026;

We have been making good progress in bbWW. I am almost done with the
processor and Aniket has been really digging into the classifier.
Great to see this from him!
</p>

<p>
Not much on the HGC side. We got a crate for the MMTS and will start
putting that together. We have also agreed to let Jim contract himself
out. We need to figure out how this will get paid,

I have been doing a lot of service this past couple of weeks. I taught
for Markus for a week (four classes) and finished the Osher program. I
then did a girlscout event and have put in a lot of time on Florian
Haslbek Thesis.
