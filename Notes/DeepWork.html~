<li>Deepwork: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to the limit. These efforts create new value, improve skill and are hard to replicate.</li>

<li>Our work culture shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting this trend.</li>

<li>The growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy most workers could do fine with out working without distraction. In the information economy, deep work is becoming a key currency. "Super power of the 21C" <a href="NowIsDifferent.html#ID-74A385A7-9226-42F5-B9E1-3EE8C93B0B43">NowIsDifferent</a></li>

<li>"Deep work hypothesis" DW is becoming increasingly rare at the same time its becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. <a href="Paradoxes.html#ID-49EAAFA4-1BD2-4FF4-9F89-F75F961768BD">Paradox</a></li>

<li>Core abilities for future: Be able to quickly master hard things. Be able to produce at an elite level. Both quality and speed.</li>

<li>If you dont produce you wont thrive, no matter how skilled or talented you are.</li>

<li>To learn hard things quickly you must focus intensely without distraction. <a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a></li>

<li>When you switch tasks your attention doesn't immediately follow, there is a residual  that is stuck in the previous task.</li>

<li>DW more valuable than ever before, yet not promoted by individuals or organizations. (<a href="Paradoxes.html#ID-49EAAFA4-1BD2-4FF4-9F89-F75F961768BD">Paradox</a>)</li>

<li>Skillful management of attention is the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience. (<a href="Buddhism.html#ID-B8D92F45-7A2D-4C17-8F8B-D7D0366544C9">Buddhism</a>) (<a href="SystemsNotGoals.html#ID-58868FF6-87DB-4C1A-8D4A-87D44E50F0C4">SystemsNotGoals</a>)</li>

<li>"Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on"</li>

<li>A workday driven by the shallow is likely to be draining and upsetting even if they seem harmless or fun in the moment.</li>

<li>Most people assume that relaxation will make them happy. Our felling of going deep is in itself very rewarding.</li>

<li>In the post enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify whats meaningful and whats not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce nihilism.</li>

<li>The key to developing a DW habit is to add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the barrier to DW.</li>

<li>People who use their minds to create value are rarely haphazard in their work habits.</li>

<li>Focus on the WILDLY IMPORTANT: The more you try to do the less you actually accomplish.</li>

<li>Act on the leading measures: you need to measure your success: Lagging vs Leading measures. Leading measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control that will have positive impact on long-term goals.</li>

<li>Keep a compelling scoreboard: "People play differently when you keep score."</li>

<li>Create a cadence of accountability: Use weekly review / celebrate good weeks / understand bad weeks.</li>

<li>Shutdown at the end of work day: If need more time, extend workday. Downtime adds insights; unconscious mind well suited for complex tasks, integrating large amounts of information with multiple, vague and conflicting constraints.</li>

<li>The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important.</li>

<li>Decades of work from multiple subfields all point towards the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work.</li>

<li>If every potential moment of boredom is relieve with a glance at a smart phone, then your brain has been rewired to point where it is not ready for deep work.

<li>Schedule in advance when you will use the internet, then avoid outside these times.</li>

<li>To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern times.</li>

<li>Put more thought into your leisure time.  Dedicate some advanced thinking to the question of how you want to spend your time "off".</li>

<li>Mental facilities are capable of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like a arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep.</li>

<li>Treat shallow work with suspicion. b/c its damage often vastly underestimated and its importance is vastly over estimated.</li>

<li>Stumbling on important insights are perfectly valid reasons to ignore schedules.</li>

<li>Time blocking is about thoughtfulness, not constraint. Simple habit that focuses you to continually take a moment throughout your day to ask "what makes sense for me to do?"   The habit of asking is what returns results.</li>
