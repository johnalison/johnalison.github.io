<h1 class="title">Democratic Party - Libertarianism beginnings and quick ends</h1>
<p>
The Democratic party was found founded by Van Buren and Benton (inspired by Jefferson) to retake up the libertarian cause. It was quite successful in the first several years (Andrew Jackson and Van Burens presidencies), but then fractured over the issue of slavery, the great anti-libertarian flaw in Democratic party. The Civil War was a complete disaster for the libertarian cause, it brought tariffs, government subsidies to big business, inflationary paper money, government control over banking, conscription, and an income tax.
