<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bi-jecttion from known sample (Usually Gaussian) to complicated thing your trying to model.</li>

<li>Bi-jection is a composition of many other bijections (each of which is invertable)</li>

<li>Trick is setting up a bijections that is by construction invertable and has many pramaters that can be learned.</li>

<li><p>
Done with Coupling Layers.
split data at that layer into two contiguous regions. (A and B)
y<sup>A</sup> = x<sup>A</sup>
y<sup>B</sup> = h(x<sup>B</sup>; Theta(x<sup>A</sup>))
</p>

<p>
 Results in bijections that with a Jacobian that is triangular =&gt; |Det| is production of diagonals
(These preserve area) 
</p></li>

<li>Separate scaling matrix to change area</li>

<li>Trick to reduce the diminionsality of latent space (above has the same as the input data)
Can enforce smaller latent dim. with something called "Real NVP"</li>
</ul>
