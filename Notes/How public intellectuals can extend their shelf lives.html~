<p>
Avoid criticizing other public intellectuals.  In fact, avoid the negative as much as possible.  However pressing a social or economic issue may be, there is almost always a positive and constructive way to reframe your potential contribution.  This also will force you to keep on thinking harder, because it is easier to take apparently justified negative slaps at the wrongdoers.
</p>


<p>
keep on picking up and learning new areas of study.
</p>

<p>
The value of having to motivate and explain things to people who don’t necessarily care who you are is high.
</p>

<p>
Be very reluctant to purge your friends and acquaintances for perceived intellectual or political wrongdoings.

<p>
I write <span class="underline">every</span> day.  I also write <span class="underline">to relax</span>.
</p>

<p>
Much of my writing time is devoted to laying out points of view which are not my own.  I recommend this for most of you.
</p>

<p>
I do serious reading <span class="underline">every day</span>.
</p>

<p>
 I review what I thought were my weaker answers or interventions and think about how I could improve them.  I rehearse in my mind what I should have said.
</p>

<p>
“What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?”
</p>

<p>
Better training has brought big improvements to the quality of athletics and also chess, and many of those advances are quite recent — when is the intellectual world going to follow suit?  When are <span class="underline">you</span> going to follow suit?
