the lowest dimension operators which allow BNV are dimension-six and dimension-seven and require |∆(B − L)| = 0 and 2,

<p>
-p100 We already measured the branching fractions for both BNV and SM decays

Answered:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why use beam-energy-constrained mass Mbc ?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trigger rates?</li>
<li>Why not also the charged conjugate?</li>

<li>VEE2 bank</li>
<li>Second of all, as BNV modes generally have less background than SM modes, the optimized values of such cuts would also depend on BNV or SM mode.
What are the backgrounds ? Why BNV fewer ? (same charge req?)</li>

<li>As shown in Fig. 20 by histograms with the error bars, events where the best candidate is fully MC-tagged account ???</li>
<li>Table 3: effiency of baseline  &lt; 100% ? What do the other columns refer to?</li>
<li>What is the conclusigon of the large failure rates with the 2D fits ? Does this mean you are only sensitive to signals with &gt;5 events
Why 2 histograms in the -logL histograms (eg: fig 35?)</li>

<li>4.6.1.2 SM Signal Extraction.: What signal are you referring to here?</li>
<li>Table 20: Which numbers should I be comparing to the PRL?</li>
<li>Fig50-56: Are the blue gaussian fits used to make the bands in fig56? What do you do about cases where the fit is very bad?</li>
<li>How does the luminosity uncertianty enter ?</li>
<li>We do not consider PID corrections for daughters of KS0 and Λ candidates since they are selected from standard basf banks ???</li>
<li>Fig 58 goodness of fit? What do the colors of the lines refer to?</li>
<li>What do you mean: Assuming that the measured central value of the BNV branching ratio in data is 0 ? Dont you measure this directly?</li>
<li>Is it OK to allow the branching fraction to be negative ?  Feldman Cousins???
What does it mean to have the upper limit be negative 4.16 ?</li>
<li>p112: Is the 2D approach justified given the low number of fitted signal events?</li>
<li>4.13.2 (Related to above) do these variations still describe the observed data well?</li>
<li>How does the goodness of fit of the "released" (unconstrained?) fits compare to the nominal?</li>
</ul>

TOP Trigger:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What did you actually do?</li>
<li>how do you get the probability density functions (PDFs?)</li>
<li>Dont understand fig 88</li>
<li>p149 However, figuring out the point of incidence remains to be a formidable task.</li>

<li>Aurora 8B/10B protocol</li>
<li>What do I learn from fig 101 and 103 ? How do I see the efficiencies?</li>
<li>What is in Fig 104 ? How do you know these are high beam-related background photons?</li>
</ul>
