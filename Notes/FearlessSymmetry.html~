<li>Not bad.  Good attempt to explain cutting edge math.</li>
<li>Tough going in the end, probably could have been done better.</li>
<li>Mathematical definitions create usage, not describe it.</li>
<li>Mathematical definitions cannot be wrong, only inconsistent or useless.</li>
<li>Lie group theory a marriage between calculus and group theory</li>
<li>Complex numbers forced on the world when solving CUBIC equiations. (Assumed x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0 had no solutions) Intermediate steps of the cubic equation involve imaginary numbers even though the final solutions are real.</li>
<li>Every root of a complex equation is already in C.</li>
<li>"2x3xR=C" the bible,  ie "pi = 3" the bible.</li>
<li>There is no (cannot be) a general method for finding all integer solutions to all systems of Z-equations in many variables</li>
<li>Pi is not in Q-Alg, this fact is apparently very hard to prove.</li>
<li>Not every number in Q-Alg can be obtained from the integers with repeated application of +,-,*,/ and ()<sup>(1/n)</sup>.</li>
<li>There is only one element of G (The absolute Galois Group) other than the identity which we can give a complete discription: complex conjugation.</li>
<li>A representation that is not faithful emphasizes certiant features of the sourse group and obscures others, enabling us to better understand the source group.</li>
<li>Some very large and complicated groups have been shown to be isomorphic to the Galois group of a poly-nominal (Including the Monster group)</li>
<li>Open conjectures: Poincare, Riemann Hypothesis, P==NP</li>
<li>Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated.
(Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? )</li>
