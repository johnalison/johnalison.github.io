There is a schedule variance of -$566k in the cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU). The variance
is from the assembly and testing of the first 32+% of modules and the
associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts
(baseplates). CMU has not received baseplates this month. Ti
baseplates have been shipped from CERN. We expect to resume module
production in December. Shipment of the CuT baseplates from IHEP are
still awaiting setup of the proper import/export protocol through
Fermilab procurement. CMU has demonstrated the 4 modules / day
protocol. When we receive more baseplates (we have ~200 hexaboards
and ~1000 sensors) we will exercise production with a rate of 8
modules / day before moving to 12/day.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$459k in cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2. This is expected
and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed
below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost
variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.

<h3 id="org3062211">Impact</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3062211">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream
delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test
stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the
components become available, the value will be earned, and it should
not impact the overall schedule.

There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$790k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two
components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping
of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-32+%); the remainder is
for supporting production at other assembly sites. This past month
UCSB has received and has begun producing modules with 12/day
protocol. In total, an additional 26 HD v3c CuW modules have been
produced.
