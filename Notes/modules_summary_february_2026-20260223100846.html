<h1 class="title">Modules Summary February 2026</h1>
<p>
 CMU has been working to increase production rate. Have assembled 12
modules/day for several days. In the past month we have built 30
(Ti/300 and Ti/200) modules, 29 of which are Grade A (one Grade B).
Hexaboards are starting to be the limiting factor, we have inventory
for 2 weeks of production. MMTS setup is also ongoing with high
priority. All the coldplates and U-pipes are installed and most of the
PLC is setup and functional. We are currently testing IV curves at
ambient conditions and will then proceed with chilling.
</p>




<p>
So far UCSB has assembled a total of 124 high-quality modules. They
have recently made 8 HD Top in a day (all grade A). A run of HD full
Ti/200 is planned next. MMTS setup is also ongoing with high priority.
Dry air has been installed, the shelf spacing has been corrected and
the cooling manifold has been redone. The next steps are plumbing and
tray insert installation.
