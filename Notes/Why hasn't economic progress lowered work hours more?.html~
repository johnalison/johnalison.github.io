<p>
Key question: Is progress real, or is it an illusion ? 
</p>

<p>
John Maynard Kaynes in 1930 says by 2030 we should have a work week of 15 hours.
  (Who is really benefiting from modernity ?) 
</p>

<p>
Income effect - as you get paid more&#x2026; at some point you can take it easy and work less
Substitution effect  - (opposite implication) if you get paid more to do something, you do more of it.
</p>

<p>
The wealthiest people use their opportunity to work more &#x2026; substitution effect is larger for top 1%
</p>

<p>
Compared to the 19th C we are working less..  ~60 hrs / week then ~40 hrs/ week now
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Income effect has been stronger</li>
<li>Today: Rich countries work 20 hrs / person (including people not working), Poor countries 30 hrs/person</li>
</ul>

<p>
Big picture seems to be right. 
</p>

<p>
However in the US and/or more recent times &#x2026; work hours / person doesn't change from 1950 - 2000.
</p>

<p>
There are big differences across groups:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cut back: prime age working men / elderly / teenagers</li>
<li>Working more: Women / high wage males</li>
</ul>

<p>
Keynes was completely right about the elderly. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Extreme bunching: We choose to consume the bulk of our leisure when we are very old</li>
</ul>

<p>
Starting wages have fallen since 2000&#x2026; less work and less pay&#x2026;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No one predicted this.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The top 1% want to work, "people seem to like work more than keynes thought". 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Big lesson in economic data "People really like work"</li>
</ul>

<p>
Is it that work is great, or that the rest of life is terrible. 
</p>

<p>
So, progress is real. But we are still working, because we like working and we like money.
