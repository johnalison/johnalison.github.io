My notebook work has been great; I'm really starting to find a rhythm
here. I haven't done much Zettlekasten in the past couple of weeks but
will get back on track soon. All the other habits have been in check,
probably need more meditation. Really getting back into lifting with
the supersets. This has allowed me to get more work done in less time.

<p>
Another couple of weeks of steady progress on the 4b side. I've been
working to understand the closure with the synthetic data. This is
much improved after implementing the rho corrections for the jet mass.
I propagated this fix to the Run3 samples as well and Marina is now
seeing good closure in SvB! Im still seeing some large FvT weights,
its unclear where they are coming from I will try to track down in the
FvT code. Marina still sees big data vs syn-data differences that I
don't. I'm starting to debug this with her.

<p>
I have been making steady progress on the L2 questions. I am now
making the acceptance-times-efficiency plots and have near final
responses to all the questions. There are some detailed questions
about the hemisphere mixing that will take longer to answer. I think
this will come after we send the first round of replies.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro has done the re-binning to make the signal flat in the SR.
This will be mainly a cosmetic change, but one that I think we should
do. He is now moving to the 2D plots (ΔR vs mass / and nViews vs mass)
needed for the AN. Chuyuan is continuing on classifier work, not
exactly clear that it is mission critical.

<p>
In bbWW, the plan is to move to new coffea release and then to Run3.
Aniket is working on adapting the processor to coffea25. He will
validate it with the previous study in Run2 before moving to Run3.

<p>
Wes got an interview for the Lederman fellowship! I really need to get
him to hone the talk and prep him for the interview.
</p>

<p>
HGC has been good. Mans tells me he is impressed with the impact my
group is making.
