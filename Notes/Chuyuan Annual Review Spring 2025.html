<p>
Chuyuan successfully conducted the analysis to search for the VHH production in the Higgs to bb and W/Z boson to jj final state. The QCD background is modeled using a data-driven method adopted from our previous ZZ/ZH analysis and the systematic uncertainty is estimated in the VHH phase space. Besides the cut based event selection, a deep neural network is fit to maximize the signal background separation. The result is combined with other VHH analysis in the V leptonic decay channels and an upper limit on the VHH production cross section is observed to be 288 times of the Standard Model prediction. The Higgs self-coupling is constrained between -37.7 and 37.2 times of the Standard Model prediction. The work is published in the Journal of High Energy Physics.

<p>
After the publication, the alternative simplified background fitting methods are studied to understand the impact of each component on the systematic uncertainty.

<h2 id="org8ccad42">Summary of research plan and recommendations of committee:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8ccad42">
<p>
The committee was impressed with Chuyuan's progress. In particular, he has already executed and published the VHH analysis in the Journal of High Energy Physics.
</p>

<p>
The committee recommends that Chuyuan focus he should focus on the "end-game": set a thesis defense date, write draft of the thesis, and start preparing post-doc applications. We would also encourage Wes to give talks/seminars at a number of universities after back from CERN.
