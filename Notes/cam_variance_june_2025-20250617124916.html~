Cumulative Schedule Variance:
</p>


<p>
There is a schedule variance of -$292k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 16% of modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts (hexaboards and baseplates). We have are waiting in v3c hexaboards. These have been shipped to Fermilab and will be forwarded to CMU. We also need baseplates. A shipment of 20 Ti baseplates is currently en route to CMS from CERN.  The final gantry tooling is in hand and is being commissioned. This will allow us to increase production to four modules per day. We have v3b hexaboards and CuT baseplates on hand to calibrate the new tooling.

<h3 id="org55f7388">Impact</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org55f7388">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the components become available, the value will be earned, and it should not impact the overall schedule.

<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$400k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$466k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-16%); the remainder is for supporting production at other assembly sites.
