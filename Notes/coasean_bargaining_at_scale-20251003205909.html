<li>AI will give a new economic layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct human oversight.</li>
<li>You will have models that are your fiduciaries</li>
<li>AGI could enable hyper-granular contracting.</li>
<li>In this scenario, the externality doesn't vanish, but it does get a price tag. And once a cost is made clear, the marvel of the market can solve it. The problem was never the pollution itself; it was the fact that the polluter was allowed to impose a health and financial cost onto you for free.</li>

<li>Re:Alignment problem: What we need to ensure is that agents that genuinely serve their users' interests will outcompete those that don't and build the right governance mechanisms.
