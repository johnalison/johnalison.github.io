<h1 class="title">Letter for Jessica 2025</h1>
<p>
It is my pleasure to nominate Jessica Parshook for an outstanding achievement award. 
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org3cedd78" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3cedd78">Award Reason:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3cedd78">
<p>
I am an experimental particle physicist working on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. At Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), we are constructing an upgrade to the CMS detector—the High-Granularity Calorimeter—which involves assembling 8-inch silicon modules that function essentially as radiation-hard digital cameras.
</p>

<p>
Each module consists of a silicon sensor attached to a printed circuit board containing readout electronics, as well as a base plate that provides cooling and structural stability. Module assembly employs automated robotic systems to integrate components and establish approximately 200 electrical connections per module. To facilitate this process, we have established a specialized manufacturing center on campus capable of producing up to 25 modules per day, with production scheduled to begin in the fall of 2025.
</p>

<p>
Jessica has been instrumental in preparing our laboratory for module assembly. Leading a team of four full-time members, she has contributed extensively to every aspect of the program, including constructing the cleanroom, installing and commissioning equipment, fabricating prototype modules, assembling and training the team, and optimizing the production workflow using methodologies akin to industrial engineering.
</p>

<p>
Jessica also serves as our expert for wire bonding operations. Each module requires nearly 600 electrical connections between the silicon sensor and the readout electronics, achieved using an industry-grade automatic wire bonder. Jessica is trained in both operating and servicing the bonder and has accumulated significant hands-on experience bonding prototype modules. In industry, this work is typically done by a dedicated — and highly paid — skilled technician. The fact that Jessica has mastered the operation of the bonder while juggling her other responsibilities underscores her dedication and skill.
</p>

<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jessica managed the day-to-day operations of our laboratory, ensuring that our research continued despite significant disruptions.
</p>

<p>
In summary, Jessica is an indispensable member of our research program. She is our boots on the ground in the lab. She is hardworking, always upbeat, and — as you can no doubt tell by now — willing to learn and grow. Her outstanding service in these past six years seems to me to be exactly the kind of thing this award is meant to recognize. She is a fantastic member of our group and has a very bright future ahead of her at Carnegie Mellon. Honoring Jessica's contributions with this award would mean a lot to our entire group.

The pandemic required Jessica to take on several unforeseen roles. In particular, was often the only senior person in the lab, she has become a mentor to several graduate and undergraduate students.  She helped supervised undergraduate summer research assistant Emma Ryan. Emma was awarded a grant from NASA to work with our group over the summer of 2020.  Jessica went out of her way to give Emma a flavour of the “hand-ons” nature of experimental particle physics, despite the required remote working conditions. Mentoring students is, again, something Jessica was not hired to do and required a skill set she did not have until recently.

<h2 id="org86903ab">Background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86903ab">

Jessica is also our point-person for wire bonding. Each module we make will require nearly 600 electrical connections to be placed between the silicon sensor and the readout electronics. These connections will be made using an industry-grade automatic wire bonder. Jessica has been trained to operate and service the bonder and has gained valuable experience bonding prototype modules. In industry, this work is typically done by a dedicated — and well paid — skilled technician. The fact that Jessica has mastered the operation of the bonder while juggling her other responsibilities is a testament to her dedication.

<p>
Jessica has been responsible for operating the main Gantry robot used for module assembly; he has built proto-type modules and has developed software using pattern-recognition algorithms to automate the assembly  process.

During covid she was directly responsible for all the day-to-day operations of our laboratory and was responsible for keeping our research on track despite the setbacks from the pandemic.

In summary, Jessica has been an indispensable member of our research program. She is our boots on the ground in the lab.

<p>
Jonas has been indispensable to our group. 
He works closely with undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and engineers, often supervising and coordinating their efforts.
</p>


<p>
I also had the opportunity to evaluate Jonas’s physics ability in the classroom. 
He was a strong student in the Modern Physics Laboratory course, earning a B+. 
During the course, he completed experiments on light scattering, neutron activation, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrating both diligence and competence.
</p>


<p>
Jonas is quick to catch on and willing to work hard. 
He has a great work ethic, good common sense, and excellent intuition.
It seems to me that Jonas Roemer is the exact type of student that you’re looking for in your program. 
He is creative, productive, and fun to work with. 
I’ll be sad to see him go; we could use more like him at CMU!
