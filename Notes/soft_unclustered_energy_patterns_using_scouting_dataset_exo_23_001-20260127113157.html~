There is a trade off in doing the scouting analysis&#x2026; a) you are
helped by the lower trigger thresholds but b) you are hurt by the
relatively crude HLT reconstruction. The paper nicely shows the gains
from a) 1000 GeV -&gt; 560 GeV HT threshold, but I am missing some
statement about b). How is the analysis sensitivity limited by the
online reconstruction? I guess the main place this comes in is the
factor 3 increase in reconstruction efficiency. Is that true? If so,
can you add a statement about how this factor of three impacts the
limits (I'm guessing not much). If not, where else does the limitation
of the online reconstruction come in. I think it would be worth
highlighting that the effect of b) is minimal in the summary after you
point out the advantage of being able to go to lower HT thresholds
with scouting.
