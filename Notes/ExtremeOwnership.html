<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very good</li>
<li>Overly wordy, but many good points</li>
<li><p>
Extreme Ownership: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure</li>
</ul></li>

<li>There are no bad teams, only bad leaders</li>
</ul>

<li>Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ego clouds/disrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own)</li>

<li><b>Cover and Move</b>: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"</li>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)</li>

<li>For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process</li>

<li><b>Commanders Intent</b> most important part of brief</li>

<li>Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in</li>

<li>Best teams employ constant analysis of tactics and measure effectiveness to adapt
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Done through post-operational debrief. What went right ? wrong ? more effective ?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Paramount that senior leaders explain to jr leaders their role and how it fits the big picture</li>

<li>One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your Boss.</li>

<li>Factors for leadership (leading up and down the chain of command)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take responsibility for everyone in your world: subordinates and superiors</li>
<li>If someone isn't doing what you want/need, determine what you can do to enable</li>
<li>Dont ask your lead what you should do, tell them what you are going to do</li>
</ul></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dichotomy of Leadership (see 80/20 and diminishing returns)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Confident not cocky</li>
<li>Leader and follower</li>
<li>Quiet not silent</li>
<li>competitive but gracious</li>
<li>humble not passive</li>
<li>calm not robotic</li>
<li>attentive but not obsessed by detail</li>
<li>aggressive not over-bearing</li>
<li>Extreme Ownership vs Decentralized Command</li>
</ul></li>

<li>This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.</li>

<li>Dont do the leadership "comb-over"</li>

<li>Good performance comes from Rehearsal</li>

<li>When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Why am I intimidated by this situation? "</li>

<li>Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>IF you have a weak leader: LUCKY YOU! 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have an opportunity to take advantage and LEAD</li>

<li>Do what you want. Motivate yourself ! Take charge. Take advantage.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.</li>

<li>The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it</li>

<li>Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do.</li>

<li>When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: That's a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"</li>
