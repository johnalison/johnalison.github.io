-) Please Don't Give Up On Having Kids Because Of Climate Change
<a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids?r=17uk7&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids?r=17uk7&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source</a>=

<p>
-) Climate change not an existential threat. 
</p>

<p>
-) Sea rise is annoying, but not transformational (except for low lying cities)
</p>

<p>
-) Climate change will probably not be a big effect for people living in the first world. 
   have already gotten about 25% of the global warming we are likely to see by 2100
</p>

<p>
-) Your parents had you despite the existential serious risk of nuclear war. 
</p>

<p>
-) Now, in the 1st world is by far the best time to live in
 history. If you think you should have kids b/c thier quality of
 life wont be as good, this implies that you dont think anyone in
 the third world should have children
</p>

<p>
-) Not many people are likely to not have children from climate change, maybe 5% max.
Likely to have a bigger effect on national politics than on carbon emission. 
</p>

<p>
-) the children of parents not concerned about climate change will
 be less likely themselves to be concerned with climate change.
</p>

<p>
-) Could also just have kids and pay a carbon offset.
