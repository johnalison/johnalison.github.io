<h1 class="title">Education is mostly signaling</h1>
<p>
Main benefit of education is to let employers know who the good potential workers are. 
Success in school signals intelligence, work ethic, and conformity. 
</p>

<p>
Evidence in favor of this view: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>School teaches subjects that aren't useful to employers and fails to teach many that are.</li>
<li>"sheepskin effect" most of the gains from education only come after having the diploma</li>
<li>What is more effective at getting a good job:  Princeton education or a Princeton degree ? Not obvious as is:  What is more effective at surviving alone in the woods: survival training or a survival training certificate ?</li>
<li>Students don't retail what they are taught.</li>
</ul>
