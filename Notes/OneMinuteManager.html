<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd9502e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short and sweet.  Very good advice.</li>

<li>The essence of knowledge is having it, to use it.</li>

<li>Effective managers manage themselves and the people they work for so that both the organization and the people profit from their presence.</li>

<li>People who feel good about themselves, produce good results.</li>

<li>Productivity is both quality and quantity.</li>

<li>One Minute Goal Setting:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In most organizations when you ask people what they do and then ask their boss, you will get two different answers</li>
<li>Always make it clear what your subordinates responsibilities are and what they will be held accountable for.</li>
<li>Each goal is recorded on no more than a single page. The goal and the performance standard should take no more than 250 words.</li>
<li>A philosophy of "No Surprises", everyone knows what is expected from the beginning.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is <span class="underline">actually</span> happening and what you <span class="underline">desire</span> to be happening.</li>

<li>Tell your people that:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You want them to succeed</li>
<li>You want them to be a big help to the organization and enjoy their work.</li>
<li>You will try to let them know <span class="underline">in no uncertain terms</span> when they are doing well and when they are doing poorly</li>
<li>Caution them that this might be uncomfortable at first. (b/c most managers dont manage this way and people aren't used to it.</li>
<li>Assure them that feedback will be a big help to them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try to catch your subordinates doing something right.</li>

<li>Help people reach their full potential, catch them doing something right.</li>

<li>If you have been doing your job for some time and you know how to do it well, and you make a mistake, the one minute manager is quick to respond.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He comes to see me.</li>
<li>First confirms the facts</li>
<li>Then explains precisely what I did wrong, and how he feels about it.</li>
<li>He lets it sink in.</li>
<li>Then he lets me know how competent he think I am usually.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The best minute you spend is the one you invest in people.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How long would you want to bowl if there were no pins?</li>

<li>The number one motivator of people is feedback on results.</li>

<li>The key to training someone to do a new task is, in the beginning, to teach them to do something approximately right until they can eventually learn to do it exactly right.</li>

<li>Unless discipline occurs as close to the misbehavior as possible, it tends not to be as helpful in influencing future behavior.</li>

<li>Chinese Fable:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emperor appoints a 2nd in command (prime minister) and divides tasks:
Emperor takes all the rewarding, PM takes all the punishing.
Whenever the Emperor asked someone to do something they might do it, or they might not.
When the PM spoke, people moved. So the Emperor went back and said lets change.
Ill do the punishing, PM does all the rewarding. When the emperor started punishing people,
they said, "whats gotten into him?" and they threw him out. When they went to look for a replacement
they said, "You know who's really starting to come around &#x2013; the PM". So they brought him into office.</li>
<li>Moral: If you are first tough on behavior, then supportive of the person, it works.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Ask brief, important questions; speak simple truth; laugh, work, and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
