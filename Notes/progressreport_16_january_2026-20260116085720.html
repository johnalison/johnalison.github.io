It seems like its been a short month, with the Holidays and kids being
home, but I actually got a decent amount done. All my habits have been
good. I want to work more on meditation, glimpses,  and sleeping on
my back.
</p>

<p>
Reading and writting have been strong. Im doing a run of English
history: the shakespeare &#x2013; the Henriad &#x2013; and a good English history
book. I want to start working through Karpathies tutorials and putting
some more time into substack. For substack, I am thinking about
starting a couple of series to put existing ideas/slides/lectures into
posts. 
</p>

<p>
I have been playing a lot of good hoops. On a sad note, Greg has left,
likely for good; I will miss him. BJJ was solid before I strained my
neck over break. I will take a couple weeks off and try to find a good
stretching protocol, maybe some intro to yogo videos. Lifting and zone
2 has filled in some gaps of BJJ and over break.

We are starting to really get settled in the new house. The pictures
are up, got an inspection (all clear), and have had a number of
mini-house warmings. The fireplace will get setup soon and then we
should be good to go.

Most of the work has been getting the Airbnb on shell. This has been a
big sucess. Perfection is not requried! We moved the big TV, got nice
pictures taken (from Sean), posted the listing, sorted out pricing,
and have had our first guests. We are getting into the rhythm of
turning the house, it actually hasnt been bad at all so far and we
have made some strategic costco runs. We have gotten some nice
feedback and have been using that to improve; we got some bedside
tables and are working on a better setup of the basement. So far so
good. We have gotten all 5 stars! No we just need to let time work.

On the 4b side, the paper has gone into CWR. This is going to be ugly
as the paper is barely viable. From my side, I have finished migrating
hemisphere mixing to python. I pushed through the Run 2 to the end and
the results look good. The migration was much easier than I feared.
Its nice to now have everything in python. I am now working on running
the mixing in '22 and '23. This will require getting the ttbar and
trigger SF implemented and doing DvT fits.
</p>

<p>
From the HGC side we are back to making modules. This has been slow
going, and we have fried some 1/2 chips. The big action item now is
hiring another tech.
