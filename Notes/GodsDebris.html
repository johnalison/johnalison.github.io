<li>Like a good deep  drunk/stoned philosophy discussion in college. Notes of Buddhism. Many worlds?
Describes the "True" underlying physics as a form of cellular automata</li>

<li>Every other question has an answer to why. Only probability is inexplicable. Its more than it seems.</li>

<li>Couldnt God give humans the illusion of free will? We'd be just as happy as if we had actual free will, and God would retain his ability to see the future. Isn't that a better solution for God than actually giving us free will and losing omnipotence.</li>

<li>Four billion people say they believe in God, but few genuinely believe. If people believed in God, they would live every minute of their lives in support of that belief. Everyone would be frantic to determine which religion was the true one.  If you believe a truck is coming toward you, you will jump out of the way. That is belief in the reality of the truck. IF you tell people you fear the truck but do nothing to get out of the way, that is not belief in the truck.</li>

<li>The best any human can do is pick a delusion that gets him through the day. This is why people of different religions can generally live in peace. At some level, we all suspect that other people dont believe their own religion any more than we believe ours.</li>

<li>Religions are like different maps whose routes all lead to the collective good of society. Some maps take their followers over rugged terrain. The maps were made by the people who went first and didn't die. The maps that survive are the ones that work.</li>

<li>The concept of importance is a human one born out of our need to make choices for survival.</li>

<li>Everything that motivates living creatures is based on some weakness or flaw. I can conceive of only one challenge for an omnipotent being &#x2013; the challenges of destroying himself</li>

<li>Everything you perceive is a metaphor for something your brain is not equipped to fully understand.</li>

<li>We are the building blocks of God in the early stages of reassembling</li>

<li>The theory of evolution is not so much wrong as it is incomplete and useless. It leads to no practical invention, a concept with no application.</li>

<li>We like to believe that other people have the same level of urges as we do, despite all evidence to the contrary.</li>

<li>There are two types of people in the world: people-oriented and idea-oriented.</li>

<li>If you seek to influence someone, dont waste time giving advice. You can change only what people know, now what they do.</li>

<li>In conversations with others talk about THEM:
When you find out how others deal with their situation it is automatically  relevant to you.
There will always be parallels in your life. Find what you have in common, ask how he likes it, deals with it, and if he has any clever solutions for it.
Find that point of common interest and you will both be talking about yourself to the delight of the other.</li>

<li>When you downplay your accomplishments, you make people feel better about their own accomplishments. Its dishonest, but kind.</li>

<li><p>
Conversation is more than the sum of the words. It is a way of signaling the importance of another person by showing your willingness to give that person your rarest resource: time.
Its a way of conveying respect.
</p>

<p>
Remember names.
</p>

<p>
Dont judge people by their mistakes, judge them by how they respond to mistakes.
</p></li>

<li>Affirmation is a communication channel between your conscious and subconscious mind. Your subconscious is often better at predicting your future.</li>

<li>Awareness is about unlearning. Its the recognition that you dont know as much as you thought you knew.</li>

<li>Ideas are the only things that can change the worlds. The rest is details.</li>
