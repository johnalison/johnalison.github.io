<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the reader is supposed to see that the notion of a blank or emptiness following death is incoherent, and that therefore we should not anticipate the end of experience when we die.  This conclusion has a bit of a mystical feel to it, even though the premises are naturalistic.</li>

<li>Epicurus deftly refuted this mistake millennia ago, saying "When I am, death is not, and when death is, I am not," but regrettably his pearl of wisdom has been largely overlooked or forgotten.</li>

<li>Although the fear of death is undoubtedly biological and hence unavoidable to some extent, the fear of nothingness, of the black abyss, can be dealt with successfully. This involves seeing, and then actually feeling, if possible, that your death is not the end of experience. It is the end of this experiencer most definitely, but that end is not followed by the dying of the light.</li>

<li>from our point of view as subjects of experience, there are no gaps during the course of our conscious lives.
for the subject there is an instantaneous transition from the experience of any preceding unconscious interval to the experience immediately following it.</li>

<li>as far as we're concerned as subjects, we're always situated here in the midst of experience.</li>
