<li>If you can identify a mental model that applies to a situation in front of you, you immediately know a lot about it.</li>

<li>mental models are short cuts to higher-level thinking.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bias Variance Trade off</li>
<li>Lepton Fake Factor</li>
<li>Closure Test</li>
<li>Circle of Competencies
&gt; Understand/be aware of what you dont know and what you are not an expert it.
&gt; Probe to find where the limits of the "experts".</li>
<li>First principles thinking
&gt; Exactly what physics trains for. 
&gt; Look for moving parts, knowns/unknowns and see how things fit together.  
&gt; Ignore the stories that you cant understand. 
&gt; Doubt everything that you cant get to from axioms.</li>
<li>The map is not the territory
&gt; Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model.
&gt; Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information.
&gt; Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
&gt; Physics Examples: EFTs.</li>
<li>Law of diminishing returns
&gt; Example of 80/20.
&gt; Get the low hanging fruit.
&gt; Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
&gt; Then choose what long sloughs to fight.</li>
<li>2nd order thinking
&gt; Consider the consequences of the consequences of your action.
&gt; Obviously want to think to as high an order as possible.
&gt; Developing trust is a great example (Be reliable ! See dont lie and be the good).</li>

Inversion 
&gt; "Invert, always invert" - Jacobi
</p>

<p>
&gt; Avoiding stupidity often easier than seeking brilliance
</p>

<p>
&gt; Index funds (Vanguard) can be seen as form on inversion
   &gt; Easy to avoid poor returns 
   &gt; Easy to lower known fees
   &gt; Together these outperform almost everything
</p>

<p>
&gt; Inversion Steps: 
   &gt; 1) Identify Problem, 
   &gt; 2) Define Objective, 
   &gt; 3) Identify forces that support change toward objective, 
   &gt; 4) Identify forces that impede change toward objective, 
   &gt; 5) Strategize. Add forces in 3) and remove from 4) 
</p>

<p>
&gt; Most people stop at 3), Inversion is all about finding problems that make things worse, and avoid doing them.

&gt; Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out wihch parts DIDNT fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion)

<li>Occams Razor (William of Ockham)</li>
<li>Hanlons Razor 
&gt; Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious. 
&gt; Stupidity far more common than malice.</li>

<li>Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated. 
(Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? ) (Fearless Symmetry)</li>

<li>Sturgeons Law: 90% of everything is crap. Look for the 10%.</li>

<li>"Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant.</li>

<li>"Applause light" Saying something that is so trite that the reversal sounds abnormal, then the unreversed statement is not conveying new information.</li>

<li>Slow is smooth and smooth is fast</li>

<li>Feelings are biochemical mechanisms that all mammals and birds use in order to quickly calculate probabilities of survival and reproduction. Feels are therefore not the opposite of rationality, they embody evolutionary rationality.  <a href="21LessonsForThe21stCentury.html#ID-1370A9D2-DED1-4E22-A3F9-DC6C8683F377">21LessonsForThe21stCentury</a></li>

Your brain works with a lattice work of mental models. The key is to understand the most fundamental models &#x2013; the ones that do most of the heavy lifting.
You can out-think smarter people if you hone your mental models and train yourself to be objective and multidisciplinary. <a href="PersonalMBA.html#ID-863419D9-9FF5-4F72-8669-2789A93629AB">PersonalMBA</a>
