The big news is that we are buying a new house! It will end up being
about a million dollars and we will probably also buy a lot of their
funiture. We will have to rent 720; the finances will be tight for
next couple of years, but should be a big improvement in qualiity of
life. I thought alot about Kareem with this decision. This is the kind
of thing that money is for; why wait ? I've starting selling off
crypto, will probably need to sell about half of the BTC and ETH for
the down payment. So far, it looks like a decent time to sell.

<p>
My habits have all been good. Meditation is getting back on track.
Would like to to start writting more, this will probably pick up soon
with DOE and other proposals coming due. I have kind of been taking a
"slow-cation" these past couple of weeks since PGSS ended. I'm
connecting to meetings and doing mission critical stuff, but
prioritizing leisure.

On the 4b side, Sindhu is preparing slides for BG2; she showed them to
FBC2 and they were all are on board with the plan. We will see what
happens when they are shown to BG2. There is another group interested.
Its not clear what they have really done or what direction we will end
up going in. I think we should try to work with them.
</p>

<p>
I now have a much better idea of the boosted 4b analysis. Both what is
actually done in the analysis and what is needed for boosted synthetic
data. I'm still puttering along with the sub-jet synthetic datasets,
but this is coming to a close soon.

<p>
On the HGC front, we are making modules with the new tooling. The
results so far have been mixed. Its not clear that this is due to the
tooling, may be bad boards/Si. Jim seems to be settling in. Josh has
left but Arvind is arriving soon.
