<h1 class="title">Modules Summary December 2025</h1>
<p>
In December CMU has assembled 12 V3C/300um/Ti modules, all grade A or
B. We have also prototyped and deployed improvements to fiducial
autolocation on shared LabVIEW code. This is now working reliably.
Total number of good modules produced at CMU is now 52 (all v3c). This
week we are exercising the 8/day protocol and might attempt 12/day
before the holidays. We have also updated the module testing software
to measure channel-level leakage current. There has been a lot of
progress on the multi-module teststand this will continue in the new
year.

In December UCSB has assembled 33 LD partials (Fives) all with high
grades. Production was done with a 12/day protocol. In total, 84 v3c
or v3d modules have been assembled. Plan to assemble another 40
modules before holidays. The multi-module teststand setup is
proceeding.
