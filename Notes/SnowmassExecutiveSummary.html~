<ul class="org-ul">
<li>describes electroweak and strong interactions up to energies of a few hundred GeV with great accuracy.</li>

<li>several fundamental questions unexplained such as the details of the evolution of the early universe, the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the origin of neutrino masses, the origin of the electroweak scale, and the origin of flavor dynamics.</li>

<li>The EF supports a fast start for the construction of an e+e Higgs Factory (linear or circular), and a significant R&amp;D program for multi-TeV colliders (hadron and muon).</li>

<li>Finally, the U.S. EF community has expressed renewed interest and ambition to develop options for an energy-frontier collider that could be sited in the U.S., while maintaining its international collaborative partnerships and obligations with, for example, CERN.</li>

<li>Finally, new machine-learning approaches are fundamentally changing the way we work.</li>

<li>General Principles:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Continue with the science identified in the previous Snowmass/P5</li>

<li>The completion of existing experiments and the construction and operation of approved projects, including those prioritized by the 2014 P5 such as the HL-LHC, LBNF/DUNE,</li>

<li>As existing approved construction projects come to a completion, a broad and complementary set of new projects should be considered a high priority to maintain the continuity of our investigations and opportunities for new discoveries.</li>

<li>Both R&amp;D directed to specific future projects and generic research should be supported in these critical enabling technologies, as well as in new areas such as quantum science and machine learning.</li>

<li>cohesive and strategic approach to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in high-energy physics</li>

<li>The HEP community must engage with: academia, kindergarten-postdoctoral training, private industry, government policymakers, and the broader society.
A structure for formulating a coordinated approach to achieve these goals should be created and provided with the resources needed for success.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>It is essential to Complete the LHC and HL-LHC program</li>
</ul>


<p>
Start now a targeted program for detector R&amp;D for Higgs Factories
§ Support a fast start of the construction of a Higgs factory somewhere in
the world
