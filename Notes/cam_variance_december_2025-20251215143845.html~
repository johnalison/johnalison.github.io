<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$628k in the cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU). The variance
is from the assembly and testing of the first 40% of modules and the
associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts
(baseplates). CMU has received baseplates at the begining of the month and  module
production has resumed in December. Shipment of the CuT baseplates from IHEP are
still awaiting setup of the proper import/export protocol through
Fermilab procurement. CMU is demonstrating the 8 modules / day
protocol now. When we exercise production with a rate 12/day before the new year.
</p>

<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$506k in cost account
402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2. This is expected
and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed
below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost
variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.

<h3 id="orgd255d16">Impact</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd255d16">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream
delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test
stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the
components become available, the value will be earned, and it should
not impact the overall schedule.

<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$839k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two
components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping
of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-48%); the remainder is
for supporting production at other assembly sites. This past month
UCSB produced modules with 12/day protocol. In total, ~130 v3c or v3d
modules have been produced.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$586k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is
consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed above.
