<p>
USCB has finished the pre-series. 5 LD right on Ti have been assembled at UCSB. A plan has been developed for ESD protection/mitigation during tape application and backing paper removal. The idea is to short both sides of the HV capacitor together and connect them to ground through a flexible, wide conductor incorporated directly into the transfer tape fixture.  
</p>

<p>
CMU has added automation for reading QR codes and sensor scratch pads. They have added dry air cabinets capacity for storage of silicon and assembled modules.  CMU has recently assembled a carbon fiber module with the latest gluing pattern. This module showed improved electrical performance as suggested by previous studies from UCSB.  
</p>

<p>
Plans have been made to have the components available for pre-production. The silicon is already in hand; the hexaboards and baseplates will be delivered to the MACs in early November.  
</p>

<p>
Orders for the gantry tooling have started to be placed through Fermilab. The orders will proceed in batches and the tooling will become available in early 2025.  
</p>

<p>
Improved automated encapsulation programs have been documented and provided to the other MACs.  
</p>

<p>
A first version of the local database infrastructure for pre-production is in place. It is ready, once we have settled on a standard part naming scheme.
