Cumalitive Schedule
-551
</p>



<p>
There is a schedule variance of -$551k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 32% of modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts (baseplates). CMU has not received baseplates this month. Ti baseplates will be shipped from KIT at the end of October. IHEP has CuT baseplates for CMU, these are not being shipped until the proper import/export protocol is setup through Fermilab procurement. 
 Last month CMU demonstrated the  4 modules / day protocol. When we recieve more baseplates (we have ~100 hexaboards and ~1000 sensors) we will exercise production with a rate of 8 modules / day.
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$415k in cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2. This is expected and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.

<h3 id="org74df3a4">Impact</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org74df3a4">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the components become available, the value will be earned, and it should not impact the overall schedule.

Cumulative Schedule Variance:
</p>


<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$749k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two
components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping
of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-32%); the remainder is
for supporting production at other assembly sites. This past month
UCSB has finally received hexaboards and baseplates. (There was been a
struggle with the delivery of the hexaboards clearing customs). With
these parts the team successfully built 8 modules per day, using a
4/module per ganrty run protocol. In total, 22 HD v3c CuW modules were
produced.
</p>



<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$544k in cost account
402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is
consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed above.
Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance
resulting from labor costs not earning value.
