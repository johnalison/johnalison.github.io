"Dear Jonas,
</p>

<p>
(With Jessica), you got us to where we are today! You took us from a small R&amp;D outfit to being in a position where we can reliably make modules at scale. Although we are just getting started, you will always have a special place as one of the original 'founders.' You set the standard by which the other technicians will be judged.
</p>

<p>
You will be missed. John"
