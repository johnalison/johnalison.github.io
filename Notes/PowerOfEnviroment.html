<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Environment is the hidden force that guides behavior. One reason it's so effective is that it speaks to your subconscious mind and not your conscious mind.</li>

<li>We become what we consume. What you read today becomes the raw material of your thoughts tomorrow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High-quality inputs offer high-quality raw materials to assemble in the future.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Who we spend time with matters.
"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."
By choosing who you spend time with you are also choosing who you want to be.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Curate your information diet to be rich and diverse.
Follow people who think differently than you.
Read old books.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Surround yourself with people whose default behavior is your desired behavior.</li>

<li>Design your environment knowing it will influence your future self.</li>
