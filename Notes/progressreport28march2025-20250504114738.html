Habits have all been good. As usual, I could use some more
mindfulness. Ive been doing some more Zettlekasten and good reading. I
have been working more in the past couple weeks and have been doing a
lot of social activities: Penguins games, Sara Shook concert, Bernie
Klus funeral, and happy hours.

On the 4b side, I think I finally have a good first pass with the
Run-3 synthetic dataset. I debugged the jet calibration and cutflow
with Marina and we are now in agreement. I then made 16 synthetic
datasets and passed it to her.  These look reasonable.  I want to
determine the impact of the correlation on the final SvB variable. I
think I understand how to do this using fluctuated event
weights. After this, it might be a good time to present in Hbb again.

We have also been doing some work on the latest (and should be last)
round of L2 comments. These required making ROC plots and setting up
at TTbar CR to make sure we are seeing the consistent data/MC yields.
We sent a mail with answers and cut a new AN. I think our next step is
ARC review.

Ive been doing lots of HGC work in the last two weeks. I redid the
"estimate-to-complete" for module production using more realistic
production procedures: the hybrid adhesive should allow 16 modules to
be produced per day. I have also started to better understand the
monthly budgets and how much we really have to spend. We will move
forward on offering James Picard a tech/machinist position. Hopefully
this will turn into something that can be supported by the
department/college. We recently started producing our first v3c
modules.

Wes gave the SoS approval talk; it went well. There were some
questions, but the analysis is approved and will be shown at Moriond
QCD! I've been iterating with Wes on his FNAL job talk slides. Its in
a good state, but needs some work. He has moved back to the stats and
will give a practice talk.
