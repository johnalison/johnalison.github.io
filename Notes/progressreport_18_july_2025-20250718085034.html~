<p>
My habits have been on track: reading, diet and exercise have all been
good. My meditation has also actually started to improve; I need to
keep this going. Steph got the loan forgiveness award! This should
give us ~$100k and (I think) guarantees her a position for 2 years.
She is still waiting on the score for her "k award", and will then
move forward with trying to get a faculty position.
</p>

<p>
Recent changes from me: I restarted BJJ! I'm doing this with Henry, so
far so good. I started taking a statin, again so far so good here, no
obvious side effects.
</p>

<p>
Have seen a lot of people recently: Rob, Saxon, T-man, and Olivito. In
general, everyone seems to be doing well. However T-man seems lonely
and worried about the IRS. Should have him over more.
</p>

<p>
Finishing PGSS later today. I think it went OK this year, although
didn't seem to connect as much with the students as last year. The TAs
were not good!
</p>

<p>
On the 4b side, AE gave the unblinding talk. We will add the extra
5/fb, to bring us to the standard 138/fb (probably should have done
this a while ago). Sindhu is making progress. She will give an update
in the Thursday meeting and then one to the B2G group.
</p>

<p>
I have been doing lots of debugging the fatjet declustering with
subjets. I think I got it in a good state. Need to regroup about the
long-term plan here.
</p>

<p>
On the HGC side we have had more water leaks in the lab. It seems like
this is now under control. Seems clear it was not related to the rain,
but to failures in the HVAC system. Input parts are trickling in, and
Jim is ramping up on the gantry.
</p>

<p>
In bbWW, we have had some movement again. I've convinced Aniket and AE
to make our code base away from bleeding edge of coffea development.
We will do something similar to coffea4bs. I had a good idea for the
background modelling similar to 4b.
</p>

<p>
Other news, Wes got a postdoc offer for SUNY! I will be outreach chair
in the fall.
