<p>
CMU has now received all of the final tooling and is preparing for four-module assembly. We have also installed a track system for efficient vacuum line and tray transport. We have made progress in uploading module testing data to the central database. We have hired a new technician who started on May 1st and two new lab technicians who will start in June and August.

UCSB has completed a run of fifteen HGCROC V3B HD Full modules; 12 with nominal hybrid epoxy patterns and 3 without the tape to stress test the epoxy. UCSB will now focus on building partial modules.
