<li>Overall entertaining, but I would say, not profound.</li>
<li>Probably missed a lot in between the lines.</li>
<li>"Words are not deeds"</li>
<li>"Would not one tiny crime be wiped out by the thousands of good deeds?"</li>
<li>"We have to correct and direct nature, and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice."</li>
<li>"If you would not do it yourself, there is no justice in it."</li>
<li>"Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world relies on self-interest"</li>
<li>"In acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am, so to speak, for all."</li>
<li>"Through error you come to the truth! I am a man b/c I err. You never reach truth without making 14 mistakes and very likely 114."</li>
<li>"To go wrong in ones own way is better than to go right in someone else"  (Not sure I agree&#x2026;)</li>
<li>"I maintain that all great men&#x2026; must by their very nature be criminals. Otherwise its hard for them to get out of the common rut"</li>
<li>"and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing"</li>
<li>"Have you seen the butterfly round a candle ? Freedom  will lose its attractions"</li>
<li>"if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long"</li>
<li>"if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying." Response: "Life would be too easy if that were true"</li>
<li>"Nothing is harder than speaking the truth and nothing is easier than flattering. If there is a 1/100 part of false note in speaking the truth it leads to discord. But if all is false in flattery it is just as agreeable"</li>
<li>"The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence"</li>
