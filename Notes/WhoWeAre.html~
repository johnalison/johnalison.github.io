<li>Our brains are powerful computers but with arcane operating systems</li>
<li>Emotions (Algorithms) very fast efficient, but often used out of context.</li>
<li>Quickly becoming gods (or racing to event new ones (AI)) without wisdom.</li>
<li>Animals with rationality - the tool that may allow us to transcend our situation</li>
<li>Optimism and hubris is built into our operating systems</li>
<li>Mans self-consciousness makes man a small god in nature, yet at the same time man is a worm and food for worms. This duality is a painful contradiction. Lower animal spared this contradiction. (Q: Are we spared other painful contradictions from our limited knowledge/being ? (Becker)</li>
<li>We are gods with anuses (Becker)</li>
<li>The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body. (Becker)</li>
<li>When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness. (Becker)</li>
<li>Real differences between us and chimps is the mythical glue that binds us. (Sapiens)</li>
