<li>Very good&#x2026; better than I remembered</li>
<li>Will do the other volumes!</li>
<li>Ends with question on what to make of approximate symmetries.. Weinberg answered this</li>

<li>Three body problem is a very simple model that shows that the power of mathematical analysis are limited and it is necessary to use numerical methods.</li>

<li>The Physical world is complex and precise rigorous mathematical definitions never work in the real world. Phyiscs needs an approximate view of nature to make progress.</li>

<li>Torque is defined in direct analogue with Forse x distance = Work.  Torque x angle = Work.</li>

<li>If Newtons laws is right on a certain small scale, then it will be right on a larger scale.
We can consider a baseball as composed of many interacting particles obeying Newtons laws or we can consider it as the ball as a whole obeying Newtons Law.</li>

<li>To solve the algebreic equation x<sup>2</sup> = -1, you have to introduce a new form of number i. Its a miracle that once you do this you can then solve every algebric equation. You might naively think that each equation that comes along may need its own new construction.</li>

<li>Imaginary numbers are the connection/unification of algebra and geometry.</li>

<li>The magnetic field in a light wave leads to a force on the electron in the direction of the wave. When light shines on a charge and the charge oscillates there is a driving force in the direction of the light beam: radiation pressure.</li>

<li>A hot stove cools because the atoms of the fuel are jiggling around around and their charges are oscillating. These oscillating charges radiate light, which takes away energy.</li>

<li>44-6 (Bottom) Echos of Deutsch. "So we see that a substance's properties must be limited in a certian way; one cannot make up anything he want, or he would be able to invent a substance which he could use to produce more than the maximum allowable work when he carried it around a revesible cycle. This principle, this limitation, is the only real rule that comes out of thermodynamics"</li>

<li>Nice way to see how the wave reflected from a fixed end of a string is inverted. The image wave travelling in the other direction has to be inverted to cancel at x=0.</li>
