<li>Fantastic</li>
<li>90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution)</li>
<li>molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air")</li>
<li>o2 produces 16x the energy than c0</li>
<li><p>
Two ways body makes energy from air/food
</p>

<p>
&gt; w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout
</p>

<p>
&gt; w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks

<li>Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue.</li>
<li>Mouth breathing ##1 cause of cavities</li>
<li>Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity</li>
<li>Internal organs are malleable</li>
<li>We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.</li>
<li>We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2</li>
<li>CO2 is the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.</li>
<li>Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2</li>
<li>Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min</li>
<li>Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers</li>
<li>With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit.</li>
<li>When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline</li>
<li>When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -&gt; pH lower: more acidic.</li>
<li>All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.</li>
<li>Breathing is the power switch to the eautonomic nervous system.</li>
<li>Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.</li>
<li>Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs</li>
<li>Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress</li>
<li>Amygdala the alarm circuit of fear</li>
<li>Chemo-receptors in brain-stem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain</li>
<li>Chemo-receptors flexibility is part of what distinguishes good and great athletes</li>
<li>Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of respiratory gases in the body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.</li>
<li>"If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath better"</li>
<li>Humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage.</li>
<li>Mouth-breathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep</li>
<li>Mouth-breathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brain secretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.</li>
<li>If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more.</li>
