<li>196 Assembly 1st 240</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is a schedule variance of -$224k in the cost account 402.04.04.04 CE - Standard Module Assembly Site 2 (CMU).  The variance is from the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables.
</p>

<p>
This variance is expected, primarily due to missing input parts (hexaboards and baseplates). We have so far received 15 hexaboards in March and have begun producing v3c modules at a rate of two per day, which have already been shipped to Fermibla. We are currently commissioning the final gantry tooling, which will allow us to increase production to four modules per day. We have v3b hexaboards and CuT baseplates on hand to calibrate the new tooling. Additional v3c hexaboards are expected later this month, while Ti baseplates will likely not arrive until July.
</p>


<p>
The current cost variance of -$155k in cost account 402.04.04.04 (CE - Standard Module Assembly, Site 2 - CMU) is due to the assembly and testing of the first 240 modules and the associated cleanroom consumables. Since funding from the FNAL subaward only recently became available at CMU, the submitted accruals reflect a lump sum covering several months of module assembly labor. These charges were submitted now to catch up with expenses that could only recently be allocated to the relevant cost account, resulting in the current cost variance.

<h2 id="orgfd1a07b">Impact:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd1a07b">
<p>
The activities contributing to this variance are due to upstream delays in receiving input components needed for the final module test stands, resulting in completion later than scheduled. Once the components become available, the value will be earned, and it should not impact the overall schedule.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcb1636b">
<p>
There is a cumulative cost variance of -$315k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. This is expected and is consistent with the cumulative schedule variance discussed below. Schedule delays, due to missing input parts, have caused cost variance resulting from labor costs not earning value.
</p>

<p>
There is a cumulative schedule variance of -$459k in cost account 402.04.04.05 CE - Module Assembly at UCSB. The variance has two components: most (90%) is due to the assembly, testing, and shipping of full-size equivalent odd-sized modules (1-16%); the remainder is for supporting production at other assembly sites.
</p>

<p>
UCSB has begun assembling a run of 15 HD full v3B modules on Ti baseplates—12 with hybrid adhesion, three with no tape. Overall, the module assembly went smoothly. They are now focusing on partials.
