<p>
Hello,  
</p>

<p>
My name is John Alison.  I am a physicist at Carnegie Mellon working on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. At CMU, we are building an upgrade to the CMS detector which involves assembling a bunch of 8-inch silicon modules &#x2013; essentially radiation-hard digital cameras. Each module is a stack of a Titanium baseplate, a silicon sensor, and a PCB with readout electronics. We have setup a small manufacturing center on campus that will allow us to make 25 modules / day,  required to meet the schedule.  However,  it takes 3 days to make a module;  the adhesive used to attach the layers is required to set overnight. So, to meet the demand the production is pipelined, such that at any given time there are 75 modules in some stage of being assembled. We can only test the modules on day 3, after the electrical connections have been made after assembly. This creates a big QA/QC problem; if we introduce a systemic defect on day 1, we can only catch it on day 3 and 75 modules would be compromised. We cannot afford this, the silicon alone for each module is about $1000. 
</p>

<p>
I am reaching out to see about using your CT scans in our QA/QC process. It would be a great if we had a way to detect problems with the modules during the early steps of assembly and it seems like your product is exactly the kind of thing what we need.  What is the cost of integrating scans in our assembly facility ?  Throughput of ~25 scans/day for about a year. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance ! 
john
