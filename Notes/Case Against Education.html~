<h1 class="title">Case Against Education</h1>
<p>
Very interesting overall. Changed the way I think about education. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Observation</b>: There is a huge positive correlation between education and pay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Three possible explanations:</b> 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>human capital</b>: eduction makes people better/more effective workers</li>
<li><b>signaling:</b> education shows employers who the better workers are</li>
<li><b>correlation w/o causation:</b> better workers are the type of people who want get educated</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Truth is likely some combination of all three.)
</p>

<p>
The big idea of the book is that <a href="Education is mostly signaling.html#ID-D17F9023-D236-421F-B7F7-3FF2A837C65F">Education is mostly signaling</a>. In which case education is a good investment personally, but not societally.  It then follows that there ought to be less subsidies for education. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
Education not just for "vocational training"
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Learn how to think"</li>
<li>create well informed citizenry</li>
<li>Arts/Humanities appritiation</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bottom line: There is little or no evidence for this in society even if we assume education is responsible for all of it.
