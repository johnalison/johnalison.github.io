I have really been working on process this fortnight. After
considering leaving Emacs, I decided instead to go all-in. I'm working
toward getting an AI agent (maybe Aider) set up. But first, I decided
to move from Obsidian to org-mode. This has led me down a rabbit hole
of Emacs improvements. This was not mission critical, but it will be a
big net gain overall. I should have used org-mode from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Habits have all been strong. Reading and work have suffered somewhat
from the big upswing in Emacs, but this should turn around soon.
</p>

<p>
The academic year is over. Wes has successfully graduated, and I will
hood him later today. My first PhD student! I have finished with
classes, final grades are in, and I'm starting to put it out of my
mind.
</p>

<p>
On the 4b side, I've completed the cut-flow comparison. I now see better
than 1% agreement with Marina. The improvement was due to correcting
some minor discrepancies and performing a reskim with the updated
calibration. I have created one seed and will launch the others once I
hear back from her.
</p>

<p>
Sindhu seems to be slowly making some progress, but I still can't
really see the narrative. I have told her repeatedly to put the
argument in slides&#x2026; it's still not there yet. We have the pre-approval
scheduled for the end of the month, jointly with the Run3 team.
</p>

<p>
There are many personnel changes in HGC. Ornella is leaving; she has
found another job in biology. Jim is starting, and he will be a strong
addition. The new class of Lab Techs has accepted. I need to make sure
they are onboarded smoothly. We will also post a job for another, more
"senior" tech to replace Ornella.
