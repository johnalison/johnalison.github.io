<li>Scientific theories are <span class="underline">explanations</span> of what is out there and how it behaves.</li>

<li>For most of the history of science it was mistakenly believed that we "derived" scientific theories from the evidence of our senses - a philosophical doctrine known as Empiricism.  In reality scientific theories are guesses &#x2013; bold conjectures. Human minds create them by rearranging, combining, altering, and adding to existing ideas with the goal of improving them. Experience is needed, but not as the source of the theories, but in order to choose among those that have already been guessed. This was first understood by Karl Popper.</li>

<li>Although being dead wrong in terms of where scientific knowledge comes from Empiricism was a great step forward in both the history and philosophy of science.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It denied the legitimacy of traditional authorities in seeking answers.</li>
<li>However it did this by setting up two new false authorities:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"raw" sensory experience</li>
<li>"derivation" or induction of science from this sensory experience</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>The key to science is that our explanatory theories can be <b><b>improved</b></b> through: conjecture, criticism, and testing.</li>

<li>Fallibilists expect even their best theories to have some misconceptions included with the truth and so are predisposed to change them for the better.</li>

<li>It is fallibilism, not the mere rejection of authority, that is essential for the (unlimited) growth of knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are "theory-laden" and hence just as fallible as our theories.</li>

<li>We perceive <span class="underline">nothing</span> as it really is.  It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.</li>

<li>What is needed for the sustained rapid growth of knowledge is a tradition of criticism. This happened in the enlightenment which was a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.</li>

<li>Scientific theories are not derived from experience, but they can be tested by experience.</li>

<li>Prediction is not, and cannot be the purpose of science.</li>

<li>Instrumentalism denies explanation exists at all. (It is still very influential especially in QM)</li>

<li>Just as conflicting predictions are the occasion for experiment and observation; conflicting ideas (in a broader sense) are the occasion for all rational thought and inquiry.</li>

<li>Define a situation in which we experience conflicting ideas as <b><b>problem</b></b>.</li>

<li>Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contradictions in reality (Assumption?), every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate.</li>

<li>"Bad Explanations": The idea that even testable, explanatory theories are not the crucial ingredient that leads to progress. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can account for all the phenomenon they are trying to explain, there is no reason to prefer one over the others (apart from Occam's razor). So a great freedom to make drastic changes (as in eg: ancient mythical explanation for the seasons) is a fundamental flaw. These types of theories are not an effective way to understand the world; even if they make predictions than can be tested.  Whether it is easy to vary an explanation with the same prediction or to vary it to make different predictions, here experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their errors. These easily changed explanation are called "Bad Explanations". If a bad explanation is disproved in favor of another bad explanation, no real progress toward the truth is made. So the scientific mindset is not about testing theories, or even refuting theories, but in seeking better explanations of relevant phenomena.</li>

<li>"Good Explanations" are hard to vary. It is only with good explanations that it even matters whether a theory is testable. (Bad explanations are useless even if testable.)
Discoveries of good explanations is hard, but the harder they are to find, the harder they are to vary once found.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Criterion for reality: a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something.
Abstract entities can be real and can play a role in causing physical phenomena (see: Hofstadter example of prime number domino calculator)</li>

<li>Occam razor: is a common way of removing arbitrariness of a bad explanation, that can sometimes yield a good one.</li>

<li>Conjectures are the product of imagination, but imagination can create fiction much more easily than reflect reality.</li>

<li>The explanation-based conception of science is why we can know so much about <b><b>unfamiliar</b></b> aspects of reality. <a href="KnowReality.html#ID-55F00H0-7HJ8-0LL0-5L45-L31L527324HJ">Know Reality</a>
Although our senses cannot detect neutrinos or quasars or most other significant phenomena in the universe, our brains can understand them.</li>

<li>The "Reach" of an explanation is its ability to solve problems beyond those that it was created to solved (SUSY with DM and gauge coupling unification).</li>

<li>It makes sense to also speak of the reach of a non-explanatory forms of knowledge ("Rules of thumb").
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eg: knowledge implicit in genes for biological adaptation)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>(To be elaborated on later:) There is something greatly significant about explanation in the cosmic scheme of things.</li>

<li>Scientific Instruments: correct errors through indirectness that is guided/inspired/designed by theory. Strips away illusions misleading perspectives and gaps.
It is amazing that object exist that when we observe them take on the appearance, other properties of other objects that are elsewhere are very different.
 (scientific instruments &#x2013; and our sensory organs &#x2013; are examples of these incredible things.)
Explanatory theories tell us how to build and operate devices in exactly the right way to make this miracle work.
Like conjuring tricks in reverse: these instruments fool our senses into seeing what is really there.
It is ironic that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it.
(An example that all observation is theory laden.)</li>

<li>To say that we have genuinely observed a thing is to say that we have accurately attributed our evidence (which is always ultimately inside our own brains) to that thing.
Scientific truth is when we have accurately attributed physical reality to theory.</li>

The Spaceship Earth metaphor and the Principle of Mediocrity are almost universally accepted among scientifically minded people.
Despite the fact that naively they argue in opposite directions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Principle of Mediocrity says how typical the earth is</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spaceship Earth emphasizes how special the earth is</li>

  -) Humans are cosmologically significant
  -) the Earths biosphere is <b><b>incapable</b></b> of supporting human life

<li>The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical: it implies that all human abilities, including our special ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any assumption that the world is inexplicable can lead only to Bad Explanations.</li>

<li>There is an intimate connection between explaining the world and controlling it.
In the set of all conceivable transformation of physical objects, there are those never happen because they are forbidden by the laws of physics;
those that happen spontaneously; and some that are possible given enough knowledge.
And these are all the options. So all potential physical transformations are either impossible (excluded by the laws of physics) or possible with the right knowledge.
If there were transformations that technology could never achieve it would be a regularity that is testable in nature, but all regularities have explanations (assumption?) and so the explanation would be the consequence of a law of nature.</li>

<li><p>
This is ultimately the source of the cosmic importance of people; they have the ability to create knowledge which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, but only by universal laws.
Anything that can create explanatory knowledge has cosmic significance. Astrophysics is incomplete without a theory of people.
  eg: It is not true that the attributes of a supernova in general are independent of the presence or absence of people, or of what these people know and intend.
      Generally, if we want to predict what a star will do we have to know whether there are any people near it and if so, what knowledge they have and what they might want to do.
</p>

<p>
eg: The only phenomena that our best instruments can detect at stellar distances are 1) extremely bright objects 2) a few things that obscure these objects 3) the effects of certain types of knowledge designed for communication (lasers/radio transmitters etc)

<li>Using knowledge to sustain life is not unique to humans; but is the basic method which cells use to stay alive. DNA is a coded description of knowledge of ancestral environments.

<li>Humans are Universal Constructors: factories for transforming anything into anything.</li>

<li>Why should only one adaptation (human intelligence, problem solving, knowledge creation) out of the trillions that have been tried have unlimited reach?</li>

<li>There cannot be intelligence in forms we cant conceive (contra to Martin Reese's claims). If there were some thing that we were qualitatively unable to understand this would be a claim that the world is not explicable and is the same as an appeal to the supernatural.</li>

<li>Minimum needed to affect change in the Universe is matter, energy and access evidence: the information needed to test scientific theories.</li>

<li>Access to evidence: As far we know all the constants of nature can be measured here and every fundamental law can be tested here. So everything needed for open-ended knowledge creation is available in the earths biosphere. Not only is the Universe full of evidence, it is full of the same evidence everywhere. All people in the Universe face the same opportunities.</li>

<li>Only explanatory knowledge can be universal. (eg: the SETI instrument is precisely adapted to detecting something that has never yet been detected. Biological evolution could never do this)

<li>Both the principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth idea are fundamentally parochial and mistaken.
Science (the least parochial perspective available to us) implies that people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things.
They are not supported by their environment, but support themselves by creating knowledge.</li>

<li>Apart from the thoughts of people, the only process known to create knowledge is biological evolution.
However the knowledge it creates (apart from via people) is inherently bounded and parochial.</li>

<li>Good adaptation and good explanations are hard to vary while still retaining their function.</li>

<li>Error Correction: Once they are physically embodied DNA and memes in human brains tend to cause themselves to remain so.

<li>Scientific discovery is profoundly unpredictable despite the fact that it is determined by the laws of physics. Before a discovery, not predictive process could reveal the content of the discovery; if it could it would be that discovery.</li>

True, but you also cant derive a factual theory from an "is" either.

<li>The point of mathematics is to understand  (explain) abstract entities. Proof is like observation in science, mainly a way of ruling out false explanations.  Mathematics (like all fields) does not seek random truths but good explanations.  The motivation for seeking a perfectly secure foundation is mistaken, a form of justificationism.</li>

<li>Another potential fine-tuning in the laws of physics: They support computational universality: so human brains can predict and explain the behavior or very un-human objects (eg: quasars)
If the laws of physics depended on non-computable functions (most functions are non-computable) we could not make predictions, and hence could not exist.
So there is something infinitely special about the laws of physics as we actually find them. They are fine-tuned for computation, prediction, and explanation.

Summary of the views of Karl Popper:
When we hear something being said we guess what it means, without realizing we are doing it. (Learning is an creative act!)
We sit here in imprisoned our heads (a dark, almost sealed cave of our skull)  forever guessing about the outside worlds: physical, moral, mathematical ect.
But we not only guess we seek explanations that remain robust against the limited input we receive, against each other, logic, reasonableness and anything else we can think of.
When we can improve them no longer we have understood some objective truth, and (at the same time) what we understand we can control. Its like magic, only real. We are like gods!

<p>
We constantly underestimate the difficulty of communication. Communication depends on guess work on both sides and is inherently fallible.
Our default assumption should be that misunderstandings are ubiquitous and that neither intelligence nor intention can guarantee against them.

<li>Different times are special cases of different universes.  Time is an entanglement phenomena.</li>

<li>Since knowledge growth is a process of error correction and because there are many more ways to be wrong than to be right, knowledge creating entities rapidly become more alike across different histories than other entities.

<li>Although Schrodinger and Heisenberg's theories seemed to describe very different worlds &#x2013; neither of which was familiar&#x2013; it was found that if a simple rule of thumb was added, each theory would always make identical prediction, which turned out to be very successful.  The rule of thumb is whenever a measurement is made, all the histories but one cease to exist. Instead of trying to improve and integrate these two powerful but slightly flawed explanatory theories, and to explain why the rule of thumb worked, most theoretical physicists retreated to Instrumentalism.  If the predictions worked, why worry about the explanation?  This meant ignoring the fact that the rule of thumb was grossly inconsistent with both theories, and not even self-consistent when applied to once observer making a quantum measurement on another ("paradox of Wigners friend").</li>

Positivism is a bad effect of taking empiricism literally.

</ul></li>

<li>Creating a good explanation is hard not because of what anyone has decided but because there is an objective reality that does not meet anyone's prior expectations.</li>

<li>One legacy of empiricism that continues to cause confusion and bad philosophy is the idea that it is possible to split a scientific theory into predictive rules of thumb and assertions about reality (or "interpretations") on the other.

<li>All scientific measurements use chains of proxies, each link in the chain is an additional potential source of error.

One can claim to have measured something only when there is an explanatory theory of how and why the measurement procedure should reveal its value and with what accuracy.</li>

<li>Static societies always have ways of bringing up children in ways that disable their creativity and critical faculties (otherwise they would not remain static.)
Static societies must leave its members chronically balked in their attempts to achieve anything positive. 
The fact that all societies before the current Western civilization where static implies that most humans before now were constrained by social convention and were unable to achieve self-expression.  
Contrary to conventional wisdom, primitive societies are an unimaginably bad place to live in. Either they are static and survive only by extinguishing their members creativity, or they are unstable and lose their knowledge and quickly disintegrate.</li>

<li>Just as genes for the eye implicitly "know" the laws of optics. Long-lived memes of a static society possess knowledge of the human condition. So ironically there is much truth in the typical static society fear of change.  Any change is much more likely to do more harm than good.</li>

<li>What sort of meme can cause itself to be reliably replicated in a dynamic society, ie in a rapidly changing environment? A true idea that is useful to all people.  To be transferred to one person it only need to seem useful to that person, to be transferred to a group it need be only a a parochial truth. The ideas with the best chance of surviving throughout many generations are truths with reach : deep truths.
Such memes are antifragile in the sense that they actually rely on the their ability to survive rapidly changing criteria of criticism (the alternative die out)</li>

<li>Rational meme: an idea that relies on the copiers critical faculties to cause itself to be replicated</li>
<li>Anti-rational meme: An idea that relies on disabling the recipients critical faculties.</li>

<li>Existing accounts of memes have neglected the all-important distinction between rational and anti-rational modes of replication. and so have missed most of what is happening and why.</li>

<li>In a dynamic society, scientific and technological advances are made creatively. They emerge from individual minds as novel ideas, after having acquired significant adaptations from meme evolution (ie: variation and selection).</li>

<li>Biological evolution was merely a finite preface to the main story of evolution, the unbounded evolution of memes.
(so was the evolution of anti-rational memes in static societies)</li>

<li>Western civilization is in an unstable transitional period between being a stable, static society consisting of anti-rational memes and a stable dynamic society consisting of rational memes.</li>

<li>Modern humans evolved from ape-like ancestors very rapidly by gene-evolution standards. Creativity is an unlikely target for sexual selection, its a complicated adaptation which we are unable to reproduce artificially. A more plausible explanation for the selection of creativity is that people choose mates according to social status, rather than creativity directly.</li>

<li>Meme evolution comes so natural to us that it is hard to see what is really going on and how special it is. Rather than just imitate someone who does something, humans try to explain it &#x2013; to understand the ideas that caused it &#x2013; which is a special case of the general human objective of explaining the world.</li>

<li><p>
Two puzzles: Why was human creativity evolutionary advantageous at a time when there was almost no innovation ?
How can human memes be replicated, given that they have content that the recipient never observes ?
</p>

<p>
Both puzzles have the same solution:
	What replicates human memes is creativity. (JA: "Learning is a creative act")
     While it was evolving, creativity was used to replicate memes.
     So at first creativity was used to acquire existing knowledge, not to create new knowledge. But b/c the mechanism to do both things is the same, so gaining the ability to acquire existing knowledge automatically selects for the ability to create new knowledge.
</p></li>

<li>Someone trying to acquire a meme from someone else has the same challenge as a scientist. Both are trying to discover an hidden explanation. For one it is in the mind of another person, for the other it is a law of nature.  Deciphering the underlying theory of the meme from the observed behavior involved the same jump/creativity as when developing new scientific knowledge.</li>

<li>Paradoxically it requires creativity to thrive in a static society &#x2013; one that explicitly suppresses creative acts. It requires the creativity to be less innovative than other people.</li>

<li>Replicating memes is the function for which creativity evolved. And that is why our species exists.</li>

<li>Contrary to Jared Diamond's argument in Guns Germs and Steel; the conditions for the beginning of infinity exist in almost every human habitation on earth.
Diamond thinks that psychology, philosophy and politics of historical events are not relevant "to the great river of history."
Counter argument: Why did the West win the cold war ? It has nothing to do with climate, minerals, flora, and diseases.
		      Mechanical theories of human history lack explanatory power and are morally wrong, as they deny the role of humans and ideas on history.
		  Diamond says that the main reason for writing GGS was cut off racist interpretations of the fact that the West came to dominate.
		  However the landscape did not cause the enlightenment, if anything its the landscape of our ideas that have far more powerful influence.
		  Knowledge alone converts landscapes into resources, humans alone who create explanatory knowledge and thus history.
		  Ideas are the determinants of the broad sweep of history.</li>

<li>The idea that the future can be scientifically planned is one that reliably causes disaster.</li>

<li>We need the capacity to deal with unforeseen and unforeseeable failures. For this we need a large and vibrant research community, interested in explanations and problem-solving. We wealth to fund it and technology to implement its discoveries.</li>

<li>The world is buzzing with plans to reduce reduction in gas emissions at almost any cost. Instead we ought to be thinking about how to reduce the temperature, or how to thrive at higher temperatures, efficiently and cheaply.</li>

<li>The growth of knowledge is a continual transition from problems to better problems, not from problems to solutions.</li>

<li>Infinite ignorance is a necessary condition for infinite growth of knowledge. Rejecting the idea that we are "nearly there" is a necessary condition to avoid dogmatism, stagnation, and tyranny.</li>

<li>Against Domesday argument (which attempts to estimate the life expectancy by assuming that the typical human is roughly halfway through the sequence of all humans):  Does not apply if the total number is going to be infinite or if the lifetimes become infinite.</li>

<li>Illness and old age are going to be cured soon &#x2013; certainly within the next few lifetimes. This would imply effective immortality for the whole human population.</li>

<li>Against superhuman minds: because human minds are universal constructors and explainers they already transcend parochial origins. There can be no such thing as a superhuman mind only further automation allowing th existing kind of human mind to be carried out faster and with fewer limitations (eg: memory). Universality implies that, in every important sense, humans and AIs will never be other than equal.</li>

<li>What we know and do not know:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Know: AI is possible (from universality) by writing computer programs; Dont Know: how to write them.</li>
<li>Know: of working examples of qualia and creativity (inside of each of us) Dont know: what qualia are or how creativity works.</li>
<li>Know: the genetic code; Dont Know: Why it has the reach it has.</li>
<li>Know: People are of fundamental significance; Dont Know: whether we are among those people, (we may fail or give up)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress, or of surviving in the long run: through seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism.</li>
