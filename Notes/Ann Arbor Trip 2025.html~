<b>Di-Higgs Production at the LHC: Current Status and Future Prospects</b> - The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a spectacularly successful theory that is known to be fundamentally incomplete. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider is, on one hand, the final missing piece of the SM and, on the other, a window into what lies beyond. Processes involving pairs of Higgs bosons are a sensitive probe of new physics and will ultimately allow the shape of the (in)famous Higgs potential to be directly explored experimentally. I will discuss the motivations and experimental challenges of searching for Di-Higgs production at the LHC. Emphasis will be placed on a new method &#x2013; using synthetic data samples &#x2013; to overcome one of the most important experimental limitations:  systematic uncertainties in data-driven background predictions.

Some more info:
</p>

<p>
The physics department is located in Randall Laboratory (address is 450 church street, Ann Arbor, MI) and West Hall (right next door, connected).  You can get dropped off there when you arrive from the airport.  If you shoot me a message when you arrive or are en route from the airport I can meet you.  If we don’t manage to connect I’ll be in my office: West Hall 354 (3rd floor).  You can leave your things in my office during the day before checking into the hotel.
</p>



<p>
We can grab a coffee when you arrive if you like, before your meetings. (The schedule will fill in a bit more before Monday morning; the faculty are always late to sign up for these but also a number of folks are away this week because of our spring break.). For dinner on Monday, let me know if you have any restrictions or preferences; there are a number of good options near campus.
</p>



<p>
Let me know if there’s anything major I’m forgetting… looking forward to having you out!  Ah, my cell if you don’t already have it: 774-212-3104.
