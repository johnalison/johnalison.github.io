Life continues to be good. All my habits are in check, but I have had
several minor personal-habit setbacks. My neck pain from x-mas BJJ was
worse and more persistent than any I have had before. It led to
shoulder pain that was so bad that it affected my sleep and I had to
take a week of BJJ. I wanted to institute back sleeping and a
stretching routing, neither of these have really worked. Meditation
has also been slipping, despite some renewed interst from some
interesting waking-up conversations.
</p>

<p>
Lots of social activities: brunch with the HEP profs at the new house,
called Reece, dinner party with Tony's gang and watched, superbowl at
clays. This has all be decent fun.
</p>

<p>
We had a big snow that really slowed things down. There was lots of
missed school. Henry was off for a week and Cyert flooded. M &amp; T were
home for several days and then got to go to the Penn ave school for a week.
</p>

<p>
The big news has been that Steph will start a tenure track professor
position in April! This will really help us get to where we need to be
financially.
</p>

We are still getting 5421 dialed in. The fireplace was setup &#x2026; and then turned
back off because of a gas leak on the first floor. The furnace has been fixed.
The claim is that this will halve our gas bills, which have been outrageous.
</p>

<p>
Also still getting the Airbnb dialed in. We have gotten a lot more
good feedback which we have been acting on. We got a couch, some
mirrors, and various kitchen accessories. So far, we have gotten 8 reviews, all 
5-star ! Now just need to let the volume grow.
</p>

<p>
On the 4b side, My focus has been on getting the Run3 mixing going. I
made a first "no TTbar" version that already seems better than the
synthetic data, but Im still waiting on confirmation. I've then put a
lot of work into getting the TTbar piece in place. I now have a good
handle on trigger weights and their validation. I got the FvT code
running and the results are promissing. The next step is just
executing on the mixing. I will then return to think about the
difficencies in the DeClustering jet masses. In the mean time I have
had some nice DeClustustering code clean up with AI. It was super
effective, the CI test really facilitate quick refactorings!
</p>

<p>
On the HGC side, we now have a lot of personellee now on MMTS.
Hopefully we can get convergence here soon. We have gotten the crew
trained and making modules again. Jessica had an saftey incident where
her fingers got partially crushed. She's OK, but we need to have a
protocol in place such that this cannot happen again.
</p>

<p>
In other news, Peter has  left&#x2026; and Mamami is leaving!
