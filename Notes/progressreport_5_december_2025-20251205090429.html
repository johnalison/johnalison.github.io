My habits have all been good. Meditation can use some work, although I
have been putting in time at nights, I should try to start using the
waking up app at night. BJJ has been very strong. I've found a nice
progression from mount and have got some subs in open mat. Still doing
lots of hoops. On the reading side I've done some more Shakespeare:
Twelfth Night and Richard II and am plugging away on Feynman Lectures.
I've gotten a bit back into writing with a write up of Believe, but
should be on the look out for more opportunities here.

The big news this month has been 5421: the MOVE! We closed on the
house. The mortgage went through fine. We've got lots of nice
furniture, it is definitely a big upgrade in quality and space! We did
lots of moving. Five beds were taken apart and reassembled, all with
essentially no problems. Still need to hang art, but we are in a
pretty good spot. The kids have been a little rough with the move and
on the new house, but we are getting there.

Lots of good news from Steph. She interviewed for a Pitt faculty job.
It went well and they want to make her an offer! Looks like this will
start in April. Her loan repayments have begun! It will be exciting to
see movement on our debt.
</p>

<p>
Lots of work now on setting up 720 for an Airbnb. I've built the beds,
moved the TVs, and bought a lot of essentials. Still need some final
prep, pictures, and website setup. We are getting close here,
probably about one week out. Looks like a lot can be written off on
taxes. Probably need to get an accountant.
</p>

<p>
For physics, my main work has been on migrating the mixing to python.
I've managed to get lots of good work here, with some big breakthoughs
on code structure. It will will be good to have as part of the new
code. Again here I am close, probably about 80% done.
</p>

<p>
For the HGC: MMTS is progressing. Some CMU Modules have been thermal
cycled at UCSB and all seem good despite the concerns at TTU. We now
have input parts again and will resume making modules in December.
