<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In 1818 the world seemly reached point where largest cities could not survive without the horse, but couldnt survive with it either&#x2026; And then the problem vanished. Solved by technological innovation. (Lesson for climate change?)</li>

<li>Given the financial crises, one wonders if macro economics is the domain of any economist.</li>

<li>Deliberate practice 3 key components: setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback, and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome. (<a href="Rationality.html#ID-E4DEB720-88F3-4E98-A7DF-175A32B68648">Rationality</a>)</li>

<li>Ambulances used to be run by local mortuary. Its hard to tin of a better example of misaligned incentives.</li>

<li>People who buy annuities live longer than people who dont. Annuities steady payout provides extra incentive to keep chugging along. (<a href="Mental Models.html#ID-D2672C2B-070A-48FA-8437-683D0B39718E">Mental Models</a>)</li>

<li>Ammonium nitrate (responsible for the population boom after the industrial revolution) an amazingly cheep and effective fertilizer. "Ammonium Nitrate feeds the world"</li>

<li>The movement to stop global warming has taken on the feel of a religion. The core belief that humankind inherited a pristine Eden, has sinned greatly by polluting it, and must now suffer lest we all perish in a fiery Apocalypse.</li>

<li>The problem with solar cells is that they are black. Need to be b/c they are designed to absorb light from the sun. One ~10% is turned into electricity, the rest is re-radiated as heat which contributes to global warming.</li>

<li>We've already engineered the earth. In a few centuries we have burned up most fossil fuel that took 3e8 years to make. Compared to that, injecting a bit of sulfur into the sky seems pretty mild. Sulfur isn't even the optimal chemical for stratospheric shield. Other materials Aluminum/plastics micro beads could be more efficient, but sulfur has proof of  principle with volcanoes.</li>

<li>After 911 the sudden absence of contrails accounted for a rise in ground temperature of 1 degree C.</li>

<li>IF you believe that the scary global warming stories could be true, that you should also admit that relying only on reducing Carbon emissions is that a very good answer. It is illogical to believe in a C-induced warming apocalypse and that such an apocalypse can be averted simply by curtailing new C-emissions. The scary scenarios could occur even if we reduce emissions to 0, only real answer is geoengineering.</li>

<li>Doctors should be forbidden to wear neckties. they are rarely laundered, perform no beneficial function in patient care, and have been show to be colonized by pathogens.</li>
