<li>Wasn't doing it for me (Bailed halfway through)</li>
<li>Could tell (got the feeling) that it was interesting to the cognoscenti</li>
<li>But too much over my head.</li>
<li>"Christianity is Platonism for the people"</li>
<li>Critique of " I think therefore I am" a thought comes when it wants, not when I want it to.</li>
<li>It is not the worst things of which one is most ashamed.</li>
<li>He who attains his ideal by that very fact transcends it.</li>
<li>There are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena</li>
<li>To make someone interested in you: pretend to be embarrassed in their presence.</li>
<li>The will to overcome an emotion is ultimately the will of another emotion.</li>
<li>He who fights monsters should be careful he doesn't become one. When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss gazes into you.</li>
<li>Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, peoples it is the norm.</li>
<li>Ultimately one loves ones desires and not that which is desired.</li>
