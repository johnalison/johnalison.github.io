<h2 id="org7a30216">Summary:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a30216">
<p>
By rejecting all mainstream political candidates, the author gets attacked for having too high-standards; shouldn't he prefer the "least bad" candidate.  Response of the article is that its the political candidates themselves who have too high standards &#x2013; too high standards for the free market system.  Government action (spending or regulation) is only justified by perceived failures of the free market. Argues that these claims of free-market failure are often overblown.

<h2 id="org7180788">Common complaints against the free market</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7180788">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sometime leads to monopoly, need to step in</li>
<li>sometimes customers have imperfect information</li>
<li>Externalities</li>
<li>People dont give enough to charity</li>
<li>sometimes people fail to hire the best person</li>
</ul>

<p>
Politicians standards for the free market are too high
</p>

<p>
Free-Market Pros:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are not free markets, but all rich countries have a history of almost-free-market</li>
<li>In contrast, there have been full socialisist countries, they have all been abject disasters.</li>
<li>There is no sign that the freest economies have "gone to far", From what we can see the freer the better.</li>
<li>US is attached for having the smaller gov. than Europe, but immigrates prefer the US</li>
<li>Free-market Monopolies are rare, and exist b/c they are the best at serving their customers. They quickly stop being monopolies, when they are not the best at serviing their customers</li>
<li>B/c people will pay huge upcharge for density means the total development package is highly positive.</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants are hired even though they are one of the least-liked groups in the country. This shows that employers are willing to put prejudice aside to hire the best person for the job. Once this sinks in, its clear that the real discrimination is the government required discrimanation against whites Asians and males.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Don’t advocate government action until you credibly show that, despite all the free market’s merits, you know how to do better.
