<h1 class="title">Modules Summary October 2025</h1>
<p>
It's been a relatively slow month at CMU as we await baseplates to
resume making modules. We have been using this time as an opportunity
to improve workflow. We have deployed LabVIEW software to auto-locate
the fiducials during production. Surveys now take less time and
require less manual input. The multi-module teststand setup is in
progress. We have received the thermal chamber and are in the process
of setting it up.

<p>
UCSB has assembled 22 high-density CuW modules and 8 high-density Ti
modules this month. The modules were produced using a protocol of 8
per day with 4 modules per gantry run. The mechanical and electrical
performance of the modules is excellent. This run of modules was used
to commission the two remaining HD Full assembly trays. The
multi-module test stand setup is proceeding. The thermal chamber is in
ocean freight and has just passed through the Panama Canal and is
expected at the end of the month.
