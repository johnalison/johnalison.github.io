<h2 id="org7e1468b">Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts (Jaron Lanier)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e1468b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decent Overall. Learned some new things. Highlighted some others that should have been obvious.</li>

<li>In the last five years, nearly everyone started to carry a device on their person all the time that's suitable for algorithmic behavior modification.</li>

<li>You can train someone using behaviorist techniques, and the person doesn't even know it.</li>

<li>Awareness is the first step to freedom.</li>

<li>Negative feedback turns out to be the best choice for business.
Negative emotions (fear/anger) well up more easily and dwell longer than positive ones.
Takes longer to build trust than to lose it.
Fight-or-flight responses occur in seconds, while it can take hours to relax.</li>

<li>Your character is like your health, more valuable than anything you can buy. Dont throw it away.</li>

<li>Fake people are a cultural denial-of-service attack.</li>

<li>What we call AI should never be understood as an alternative to people, but instead as a mislabeled new channel of values between people.</li>

<li>Gaming should be turning into the new way we learn and talk about complicated issues.</li>

<li>Experience is a mystery deeper than other mysteries, because we know of no way to break it into parts to study it.</li>

<li>Consciousness is the only thing that isn't weakened if its an illusion. You'd have to experience the illusion in order for the illusion to exist.
But the flip side of that is that if you choose not to notice that you're experiencing, you can negate your own consciousness.</li>
