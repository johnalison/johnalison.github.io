<li>It was really special to have John take us on a tour of his manufacturing facility. thanks again! 10/13/2025 6:16 PM</li>

<li>Great course / great and brilliant instructor .., among the best I’ve taken over many years.</li>

<p>
Thank you, John

<li>I look forward to taking more classes from John</li>

<li>He’s brilliant, and a great teacher.</li>

<li>Instructor made the course interesting and left me wanting more.</li>

<li>John's preparation paid HUGE dividends to all attendees. I speak from the least-physics-</li>
</ul>
<p>
educated sector, and I can say unequivocally that John offered us all a lot. First rate!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The instructor was very informative. He discussed the subject matter in a way that was</li>
</ul>
<p>
approachable for individuals with minimal knowledge in the area
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Maybe the best organized class I have ever taken. Fast moving and very engaging.</li>

<li>John is fabulous! His classes were extremely informative, informal and fun. He presented</li>

<p>
physics in a logical, interesting way, engaging the whole class. I hope he teaches more
classes
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This was by far the most enlightening OSHER class I have taken. John Alison is an excellent</li>
</ul>
<p>
teacher and was able to make this most complex of subjects relatable &#x2026; if not always totally
comprehensible. I am sorry I missed his previous course on the history of particle physics,
and hope that he gives it again so I can catch it the next time. I should qualify my answer on
his ability to engage class participants: while he did not go out of his way to draw the audience
in (that is, he did not ask questions of the audience), he was extremely kind and accepting of
all the questions asked of him, which created a very welcoming atmosphere that perhaps
passively encourages audience participation by not intimidating questioners. And, truth be told,
there were so many question asked by the audience along the way, and he took each one
graciously and carefully, that had he also asked questions of the audience he would have had
little time to actually present his material &#x2026;. which would have been a shame. The lab tour
was a great part of the course - it really communicated in ways I didn't previously appreciate
just how big physics is done, and how academics willingly allow themselves to be cogs in a
machine in order for very high level research to be done by a global network.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Phenomenal teacher. Was able to take ridiculously complicated concepts and simplify them</li>
</ul>
<p>
down to my level, which was pretty low. I wish he would teach other classes and explain
relativity and superstring theory, etc.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very interesting. Right level of detail for this type of course</li>

<li>Very engaging. Wonderful to hear and see important work being done right on campus.</li>

Hi Again,
</p>

<p>
Ive made a copy of today's lecture slides available here: 
<a href="https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/9vC3clA2RyToTyj">https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/9vC3clA2RyToTyj</a>
</p>

<p>
I've also make the slides from the previous lecture series available here:
<a href="https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/OEnBmZsywtAJpsj">https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/OEnBmZsywtAJpsj</a>
</p>

<p>
Going forward, I will make these pdfs available before the lectures.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to read these beforehand, they are just there for those who want to follow along as we go through them tomorrow or to review afterwards.
</p>

<p>
See you next week!
john

Hello,
</p>

<p>
  My name is John Alison and I will be the instructor for the Experimental Particle Physics Course.
Reminder that the course will be held weekly on Wednesdays from 11:00 - 12:30 PM in Osher Room B, starting on September 10th. There will be four sessions, ending on October 1st.
</p>

<p>
Here is my plan for four weeks. 
</p>

<p>
Week 1: The Standard Model and the Higgs
</p>

<p>
Week 2: The Cannon and the Camera
</p>

<p>
Week 3: The Discovery of The Higgs Boson
</p>

<p>
Week 4: Whats next ? Discussion and field trip. 
</p>

<p>
There will be no homework is there is no required reading/work before hand.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to getting started! 
john

Title:  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Particle Physics after the Discovery of the Higgs Boson : Are We Done ?  
</p>


<p>
Description:  
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The Standard Model of particle physics is a spectacularly successful  
theory of the fundamental constituents of the Universe and their  
interactions. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron  
Collider is, on one hand, the final missing piece of the Standard  
Model and, on the other, a window into what lies beyond. In this  
lecture series we will discuss the Standard Model of particle physics  
and highlight the important role of the Higgs Boson in the theory.

<h2 id="org6ab62e2">Biography:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6ab62e2">
<p>
John is a High-Energy Particle Physicist working on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Switzerland. He was part of the team that discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.  
</p>

<p>
John grew up in Pittsburgh; he graduated from Baldwin-Whitehall high-school and then studied physics and philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. He went on to earn a Ph.d. in physics at the University of Pennsylvania and won several thesis awards for his dissertation on the discovery of the Higgs boson. John was then a fellow at UChicago, before joining the physics faculty at Carnegie Mellon in 2018.  
</p>

<p>
John is currently building particle detectors at CMU which will be installed at CERN for upgrade to the LHC. These detectors are all being built and tested in Pittsburgh, with local CMU students and engineers, before being sent to Geneva.
