Hello Alissa, 
</p>

<p>
My name is John Alison and I am with the physics department at CMU. A colleague forwarded your mail about your son being interested in physics. 
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple ideas:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My #1 top recommendation is doing the PGSS  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/pgss/">https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/pgss/</a>
This is for rising seniors to come to campus for a month and take classes, so you still have some time to prepare. It's a great program, exactly designed for students who want to go deeper in science.</li>
<li>If he wants to take a "field trip" to campus I'm happy to discuss my research with him and show him my lab
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My usual advice to students is to get a solid grounding in the core physics material: eg: classical physics and E&amp;M.  These are very well covered in any of the various intro university physics books. ChatGPT or Claude are probably even better. I would recommend him asking them for a self-study curriculum. These are nice b/c he can tailor it to the specifics of his background.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
There are also very good books aimed at a general audience/ aspiring physicist that you could read without having advanced classes.  My favorites are:  
</p>

<p>
-) Steven Weinberg "Dreams of a Final theory"   
-) Richard Feynman "The character of physical law"  
-) Richard Feynman "QED: The strange theory of light and matter"  
</p></li>

<li>Once you have a grasp of the basic material I would recommend having a look at  
"The Feynman lectures in physics"</li>
</ul>
<p>
These cover the same material in a more advanced way.  
They can be very valuable even if you don't understand everything in them (even I still don't!)
</p>

I would say the best thing to do is get a solid grounding in the core physics material: eg: classical physics and E&amp;M.

<p>
Once you have read that I would recommend having a look at  
    "The Feynman lectures in physics"
These cover the same material in a much more advanced way.

<p>
I would definitely have a look at those.
