<p>
Dear Julie, Swagata, Arne, and Loukas,
</p>

<p>
I would like to nominate Marina Kolosova for the DiB and Resonance L3
position in B2G. I have known Marina for two years, initially when she
reviewed my analysis (ZZ/ZH -&gt; 4b) as an ARC member, and more recently
as a close collaborator on the Run2+Run3 HH -&gt; 4b analysis. She would
be a great fit for this position!
</p>

<p>
Marina is an expert in diboson physics. She is leading the Run3 HH-&gt;4b
effort and has performed and reviewed several other diboson analyses.
She has a solid understanding of the CMS review process.
</p>

<p>
Marina coordinates our (relatively large) Run2+Run3 HH -&gt; 4b effort.
She is an efficient coordinator and an effective communicator. There
are several groups pursuing this analysis, and coordination between
them can  be delicate at times. Marina has skillfully managed these
political complexities.
</p>

<p>
I cannot comment on her availability, but she would be a major asset
to the PAG if you can convince her to take on this role.
</p>

<p>
John
