All is good.  Not drinking has been a lot less consequential that I thought: its easier and there haven't been that big of productivity gains. However, my sleep and fat composition seem much better; will keep at. Reading, exercise, and diet have been good. Meditation and Zettlekasten still needs work. Thinking of setting up a kubernettes cluster for database monitoring ect.

There has been lots of progress on the code base: pseudo-data and trigger weights have been debugged. Ive added four-tag data skims and outputing all the datasets to eos. Ive cleaned up flags to config different options, unit tests have been key here. The synthetic data processing is more or less integrated into production running. I'm starting a more detailed look at performance of synthetic data. I will do PDFs by year and some other tests before moving on to Run-3.

AE is starting on the low pt analysis.  We understand to do the three tag veto, everything else should be straight forward.

Still no progress on FvT or SvB debugging. Chuyuan is working on getting the output properly debugged. Once this is done number of questions: gain on kλ from SvB refit / FvT with ZZ/ZH SRs, tt vs no tt.

More chatting with Sindhu. Its hard to tell if she is actually making progress here. Would be nice to see come concrete steps forward. eg: slides that she starts building on.  She is currently debugging double peak and will start looking into running systematics on mixed data. We need a talk in B2G and a MC request.

Aniket is still debugging neutrino reconstruction. I like the neutrino weighting idea.  To make progress he will set up a unit tests with a few dozen events. Sam and I can then help debug.

Still kind of in coasting mode. We now have Si in the lab and need to get the new cabinets setup and to get a really nice humidity monitoring system going. (Maybe a good use for the postgres DB)

Wes is making sense of the combine fits. Lot of the problem was missing Bkg predictions in bins that had observed data.  Needs to repeat the scans then move forward with the apporval.
