<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the lifetime of hadrons containing b quarks is of the order of 1.5 ps, while the lifetime of c hadrons is 1 ps or less.</li>

<li>The impact parameter is defined to be positive or negative, with a
positive sign indicating that the track is produced “upstream”.
This means that the angle between the impact parameter vector and
the jet axis is smaller than pi/2, where the jet axis is defined by
the primary vertex and the direction of the jet momentum.</li>

<li>tracks are required to have pT &gt; 1 GeV, (Any gain from going lower?)</li>

<li>(pre/post APV) The requirement on the number of hits was relaxed to
cope with saturation effects that were observed at high occupancy in
the readout electronics of the strip tracker during the first part
of the 2016 data taking, leading to a reduced tracking and b tagging
performance. The issues with the readout electronics have been fully
resolved, with no side effects on the track- ing performance, but
the relaxed requirement on the number of hits was kept since there
was no impact on the final b tagging performance.</li>
