<p>
My habits have all been good. I've been really getting into BJJ and
Shakespeare these past weeks. Crypto selling is proceeding according
to plans. MPL is going well. I am almost done with the first
experiment and it will be all downhill from there. My Osher course has
started. This should be fun.
</p>

<p>
The past two weeks have been fairly social. We had a group-5 (Henry)
familes reunion at the racquet club pool. Sarah Eno came for a
colloqium. I did the Freedom debates with Mark.
</p>

<p>
On the work side, I submitted a proposal for the Jone's
interdisciplinary fund. This was the data-driven SR study that Soheun
has been doing. I think it makes a compelling story, hopefully will
get funded.
</p>

<p>
I've beeng doing lots of coding to make the plotting common between 4b
and bbWW. This is now in a good spot. I need to get back to making
phyiscs progress.
</p>

<p>
On the 4b side we have chatting with Mauro to get him to be part of
our team. Looks like this will happen.
</p>

<p>
On the HGC front we have been cranking modules. We can now can do 4 / day
and overall the module quality has been high. I think it might be time
to look into hiring another tech.
