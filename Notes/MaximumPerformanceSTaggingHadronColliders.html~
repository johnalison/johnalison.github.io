<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cherenkov detectors were used to identify s-jets, exploiting their identification power for charged kaons.</li>

<li>strange-hadrons, such as kaons and lambda baryons, do not only appear in the fragmentation of s-quarks but also are frequently part of d- and u-jets.
identification of these strange-hadrons is experimentally challenging:</li>

<li>K+/- and k<sub>L</sub> are long-lived.
K+/- can in principle, be distinguished from other charged particles with the use of Cherenkov detectors or dE/dx
     (Neither viable at the LHC)</li>

<li>The s-tagging performance for a tagger based on tracking information was found to be similar for d- and u-jets [44], so that we limit ourselves in this study to 𝑑-jets as the only background class.
(Really, no infor in jet charge?)</li>

<li>the leading particle tends to be a strange-hadron (mostly kaons), while for d-jets, the leading particle is more likely to be a light hadron — in particular a pion</li>
