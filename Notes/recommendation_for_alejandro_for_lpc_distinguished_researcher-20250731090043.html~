<h1 class="title">Recommendation for Alejandro For LPC Distinguished Researcher</h1>
<p>
Dear Colleagues, 
</p>

<p>
I am writing to recommend Alejandro Espinosa for the CMS LPC
Distinguished Researcher program. Alejandro is a postdoc in my group,
focusing on HH→4b and on extending the jet calibration to low pT (~10
GeV). He has been an invaluable asset to our group and is excited
about this opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro is well qualified for this role: he is already collaborating
closely on a physics analysis with members of LPC, has exciting new
ideas for expanding the CMS DAS, and has a plan for getting involved
in the CMS upgrade that would be a significant benefit to FNAL and the
US upgrade project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Work to date</b>
</p>

<p>
My group works closely with Jaco Konigsberg (FNAL XXX) on HH→4b
analyses. We are currently performing a search for HH→4b production
using Run 2 + ('22+'23) data. Alejandro performed the Run 2 analysis
and is responsible for the final combination. This paper is expected
out later this year and will have a combined limit of ~4 times the SM
prediction (more than twice as sensitive as the previous result).
</p>

<p>
In addition to HH→4b, Alejandro is also working with my student
(Aniket Khanal) on reducing jet pT threshold in HH→bbWW*.
We have demonstrated that—due to the off-shell W* in the Higgs boson
decay—lowering the threshold from the nominal value of 25 GeV
to 10 GeV doubles the signal acceptance. Alejandro is responsible for
extending the jet calibration below 25 GeV, which is the current
threshold for the calibration provided by the CMS POG.
</p>


<p>
Alejandro is a natural leader. At CMU, we have a large CMS group with
four active faculty members supervising over a dozen students engaged
in a wide range of analyses. Our group has made a concerted effort to
coordinate all analyses around the use of coffea. Alejandro serves as
our point person for onboarding students and new postdocs. He has been
integral in both shaping the overall software structure and providing
ongoing support to our codebase's users.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro is active on the Coffea, CAT, and REANA Mattermost channels
(username: algomez) and has developed several tutorials focused on
Coffea. Recently, he led the CMSDAS/HATS jet tutorials [1], where he
migrated an older C++/Python-based tutorial to use Coffea. He has also
developed a Snakemake/REANA tutorial [2], which he presented at a CAT
hackathon.
</p>

<p>
<b>Plan for LPC DR</b>
</p>

<p>
Alejandro has ambitious plans for his time at the LPC. On the analysis
side, my group will continue collaborating on HH→4b. We are currently
planning the analysis with the full Run-3 dataset. Alejandro will
continue to play a leading role in this effort.
</p>

<p>
In addition, he has a compelling idea for extending the analysis to
target the low-mHH region using low-pT jets. In the current HH4b
analysis, acceptance at low mHH is limited by jet pT thresholds
imposed by the trigger. These lower mHH events are especially valuable
as this phase space is the most sensitive to the Higgs self-coupling.
The current analysis requires that the b-tagged jets from the Higgs
satisfy the trigger thresholds. Alejandro's idea is to search for
HH→4b + ISR/FSR jet where the additional jet satisfies the trigger
criteria. This would allow us to recover events in which the lowest
b-jet is below the trigger requirement. A preliminary proof-of-concept
study suggests that the acceptance at low mHH can be doubled by
lowering the threshold on the softest b-jet to 15 GeV. This proposed
work naturally complements both the existing HH→4b analysis and his
jet calibration work in HH→bbWW. Constraining the self-coupling is a
flagship CMS result where it is important that USCMS and Fermilab have
a leading role.
</p>

<p>
On the educational front, Alejandro has plans for developing his
Snakemake/REANA tutorial into a Hands-on Advanced Tutorial Sessions
(HATS) on reproducible analysis workflows. This will show students
modern programming practices, including continuous integration (CI),
extensive use of unit tests, and regular result replication with
REANA. These practices make the codebase more robust, the entire team
more productive, and provide students with valuable experience
transferable beyond HEP.
</p>

<p>
The other major component of Alejandro's LPC residency will be devoted
to HGCAL upgrade work at the Fermilab Cassette Assembly Facility
(CAF). Involvement in the HGCAL is a natural fit for Alejandro. CMU
serves as a Module Assembly Center (MAC); my group assembles and tests
silicon modules for the HGC that are then sent to the Fermilab CAF.
Alejandro proposes to work at the Fermilab CAF, collaborating with
Zoltan Gecse and Don Lincoln to integrate module testing and
commissioning into cassette assembly. Aniket Khanal is developing the
testing software to be used at both the MAC and the Fermilab CAF. As
mentioned above, Alejandro is already working closely with Aniket on
bbWW, so it is natural to extend this collaboration to the upgrade
project. Increasing the bandwidth between the MAC and the CAF will be
critical to the project's success. Alejandro is perfectly suited for
this role. The LPC DR program provides a natural bridge between these
assembly centers.
</p>

<p>
In summary, I believe Alejandro would be an excellent fit for this
position. He brings the required experience and enthusiasm, and his
current work and proposed program aligns well with the position’s
goals. As PI, I would fully support Alejandro in this role with my
group's resources and graduate students. This opportunity aligns well
with my group’s priorities, and I am confident that Alejandro’s
contributions will make a substantial impact.
