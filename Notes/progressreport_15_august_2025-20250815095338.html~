I have more or less continued my stay-cation these past two weeks. I
have only had one clean working day in the past two weeks, as the kids
have been off from school. My babits have all been good. Its now been
one year since I have stopped drinking. It continues to be much easier
than I would have thought. It is simply a non-issue at former binging
oppurtinuties. I will keep this up. My habits have all been good;
meditiation continues, and could maybe use a bit more work. Reading
has been strong.

News on the financial front: Stephs K award did not get discussed. It
is still unclear why, but the upshot of this is that she may end up in
a faculty position sooner. She is going to talk with the head of the
department soon. Steph seems to think that she may have a faculty job
in January!

On the new house front, I have been selling a lot of crypto for the
down payment. Its a great time to sell! We've seen all time highs in
BTC and ETH, hopefully this can continue. We will also buy M&amp;As
funinture in the end ~26k&#x2026; will be worth it.

Almost all of my work these past two weeks has been on the DOE
Proposal. I have a first draft for my parts, which I think is strong.
My previous progress and ongoing activities really boost the
credibility; excited to see if this pays off. The others are late, as
usual.

In the 4b side, Sindhu gave a solid talk in B2G. I have since pinged
DESY and Chyanit and they seem open to working together. AE has been
refactoring the coffea4bs code to be able to integrate bbWW and 4b. I
will start looking into the mixed data cutflow.

On the HGC side, we have been seeing problems with the modules since
moving to the new toolling. Still not clear if its tooling, or
comprimised inputs parts. Would be good to get back to 300um / Ti /
v3c and see that the modules are of high quality.
