<h2 id="org1fd4926">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1fd4926">
<p>
The paper presents a search for a hypothetical scalar boson X decaying
into another scalar S and a SM Higgs boson in the bb+gamma-gamma
(bbgg) final state. No significant deviation from the SM expectation
is observed.
</p>

<p>
This search is a natural extension of the important HH-&gt;bbgg search.
There have been several results in the field targeting the X-&gt;SH
signature in various final states. The bbgg channel offers unique
sensitivity in the low-mass region.
</p>

<p>
The results presented here are an extension of previously published Run
2 results (JHEP 11 (2024) 047). The new result has improved analysis
techniques and adds data taken in 22 and 23. Relative to the previous
analysis, the object reconstruction, identification, and calibration
were improved. There was also a reoptimization of the size of the mgg
SR. This result improves the sensitivity (by ~15&#x2013;75%), where only
9-30% of improvement is expected from the additional data alone.
</p>

<p>
The background is relatively small and can be reliably estimated from
mgg sidebands.
</p>

<p>
My only significant comment is that more figures should be made public
to aid in presenting the material, e.g.: mgg plots, PNN in the CR and
distribution of the key PNN inputs: CR, SR and high PNN output. Plots
of PNN and inputs before and after reweighting.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaec43b0">
<p>
"These normalisation factors are used to correct the normalisation of
the γγ+jets background components in the SRs and CRs before the
likelihood fit described in Section 7. They are then allowed to float
in the fit."
</p>

<p>
Are these normalisation factors constrained in the fit by the CR
uncertainties? If not, why not? Seems justified. If so, say it here.

<h3 id="org1f433a1">Section 5.3 Residual gg+jets discrepancy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1f433a1">
<p>
"After applying those factors, a residual discrepancy between the PNN
  distributions of the 𝛾𝛾+jets processes in data and simulation is
  still observed in the CR. This discrepancy is most prominent in the
  m<sub>bb</sub>*gg and m<sub>b</sub>*gg distributions."
</p>

<p>
Confused by the statement that the discrepancy is in the PNN
distributions. The next sentence you say it is m<sub>bbgg</sub> and m<sub>bgg</sub>,
which are inputs to the PNN. What PNN distribution shows this
discrepancy? I guess it's the PNN in the CR, as you can't judge
background mismodelling in the SR. If so, should say that.
</p>

<p>
Why not correct the input gg+jets variables with the event weight
before training the PNN? I would at least use that as a systematic
uncertainty. e.g.: how does the change in PNN output with and without
this re-weighting compare to the change in PNN output with Sherpa vs
Madgraph, which you use to assess systematic uncertainties?

<h3 id="org4263c60">Section 7: Cross section discusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4263c60">
<p>
"The signal strength μ is treated as the parameter of interest and is
defined as the ratio of the observed event rate to the expected event
rate, where the latter is computed assuming a 13 TeV cross-section
equal to the observed upper limits from the previous analysis [18],
and the 13.6 TeV cross-section as introduced in Section 3. The choice
of the 13 TeV cross-section value is arbitrary, as it does not impact
the limits or observed significance values."
</p>

<p>
The first sentence talks about using both the cross-sections at 13 and
13.6 TeV. The next sentence then says the choice of using (presumably
only) the 13 TeV cross-section is arbitrary. Please clarify the text.

<p>
"Most of them fail to pass the current 2 b-tagged preselection, either
because a photon is now reconstructed as an electron, or because a jet
is no longer tagged as a b-jet"
</p>

<p>
Sounds like something has also changed in the track reconstruction as
photons are now being reconstructed as electrons. It would be good to also
discuss this when talking about changes to the analysis.

<li>Section 6: It would be good for the reader to have a high-level

uncertainties at the beginning; this would help to put this section
in context. (e.g.: your last sentence of this section "Even for the
mass point with the largest systematic uncertainty, the results are
dominated by the statistical uncertainty." should be in the 1st
paragraph.)</li>

<li>"adjacent bins are iteratively merged until the rightmost bin
