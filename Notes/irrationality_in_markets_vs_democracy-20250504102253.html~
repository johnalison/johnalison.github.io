<h1 class="title">Irrationality in Markets vs Democracy</h1>
<p>
Markets behave differently than democracy; shopping is not like voting. In the marketplace, when a consumer has an irrational opinion, they bear the full price. When a voter is irrational, the public picks up most of the bill.
</p>

<p>
People often doubt the link between increased unemployment and higher minimum wages. However, when it comes to jobs they are actually applying for, they know they demanding too high a salary requirements will hurt their chances.
</p>

<p>
Voters do not buy policies.
