<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5c3630f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Average overall. More of a memoir than anything.</li>
<li>During the Cuban missile crisis an American ICBM was launched. It was a routine test that no one thought to reschedule.</li>
<li>After missing a bid for a Govt. contract, start-up company went out and loaned their employees to other companies that had gotten the contract as a way to keep their talent in house.</li>
<li>"Megaton to Megawatts" project blended down Soviet uranium in old bombs for use in commercial power reactors in the US.</li>
<li>Upward progress in human violence and global political trends hopeful, but nuclear conflict could in blink be the ultimate reversal.</li>
<li>Our chief peril is poised nuclear doom, too far out of global public consciousness.</li>
<li>"Our problems are man-made, therefore, they can be solved by man" JFK</li>
<li>The problem is not how long it will take governments to reduce nukes to zero, but that governments now aren't moving at all.</li>
<li>Key to constructive action to prevent nuclear weapons being used is education of the public.</li>
