<p>
CMU has commissioned the final tooling and on-boarded a new technician
using (CuT + v3b boards) modules. In total we have produced 12 v3b
modules. Once tooling was commissioned we moved back to production. We
have since produced 3 CuT + v3c modules and are switching to Ti
baseplates which we will proceed with now. We have 25 Ti baseplates
which continues to be our limiting factor. In other news, we have
received all the MMTS power supplies and distribution systems; the
relevant parts have been shipped to TTU and UCSB and we are in the
process of testing the chiller now.
</p>

<p>
Production at UCSB is limited by a lack of baseplates. A package of
baseplates was waiting to clear customs; this is now moving. Module
production will continue as these parts become available. The next
planned modules are LD top and LD five, which are needed for cassette
testing. In the meantime, UCSB has been studying the irradiated
modules. These modules are being thermal cycled and undergoing
extensive electrical tests. So far, all results are as expected.
