<p>
I have been taking it easy these last two weeks. My habits have all
been good, but I need more meditation. This was my first time
participating in graduation celebrations. I hooded Wes and read the
honors for the physics ceremony.
</p>

<p>
I have really been maxing out on emacs. I set up: dired, bookmarks,
screenshots, magit, auto commits, email, gcal sync, gptel, and copilot
chat. I now have a solid system. Going forward, I need to fine-tune
the Python development and copilot.
</p>

<p>
The Run3 4b synthetic data now looks much better. From what I can
tell, the normalization is nearly spot on. It seems like there may be
mis-modeling when SvB is near zero. I will investigate this next.
There has been some movement from Sindhu. She has found some kinematic
cuts that remove the double peak structure with no signal loss. I have
told her to write this up in slides and proceed to the closure test.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work these past two weeks has been updating the HGC slides
for June. I have it in a good spot. We are making progress on the
MMTS. The dry air system was purchased and sent to UCSB. We have
Keithley devices and are starting to receive a stream of other parts.
We have an ad out for an Ornella replacement. I will start looking
into that this week.
