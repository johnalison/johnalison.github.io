<h1 class="title">Potential of Insight</h1>
<p>
Insight gained from the direct approach of meditation &#x2013; ie: directly examining who or what you are &#x2013; can fundamentally change your understanding of yourself and reality. 
</p>

<p>
This insight (or awakening) is the realization that <a href="Our Default Point of View.html#ID-D88EB65B-F2C5-4FEC-8247-577F4D78C173">Our Default Point of View</a> is not who we really are. Instead, we see that, experientially, <a href="We are a point of view, not a separate thing.html#ID-CEB86AF8-C9F1-4BBE-A83C-58C18922FEE0">We are a point of view, not a separate thing</a>.
</p>

<p>
The insight often comes in three distinct steps: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first is the basic recognition that you are not the narrative. Your emotions and thoughts are not you, they are separate things that you observe.  This is a negative realization, you are not what you thought you were.</li>
<li>The second is the realization that you are the subjective presence; the perceiver, not the perceived.  This comes from looking for the meditator, and realizing that they cannot be found. This is a positive insight, you are the point of view, the stage on which things appear.  (The pure subjectivity is sometimes referred to as emptiness, non-objectivity)</li>
<li>The third insight is that which perceives is not and cannot be independent of what is perceived. They are in a one-to-one correspondence.  (Often called non-dual, one is the negative space of the other) Ying-and-yang. You cannot have the background alone without the foreground.</li>
</ul>
