<h1 class="title">Quantum Field Theory In A Nutshell</h1>
<p>
Great in places, but average overall.  Thin on details. More of an appetizer for a theorist.
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons condesed matter physics is interesting is that extremely complicated many-body effects can result in the effective low energy degreems of freedom being totally different from the electrons and nuclei they start out with. 
</p>

<p>
Topological solitons are a big deal because they showed that underlying field is important, not just the pertubation arrived at using with Feynman diagrams.
</p>


<p>
There are elegant relationships between the eigenvalues and the determinant and trace of a matrix
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The determinant equals the product of the eigenvalues.</li>
<li>The trace equals the sum of the eigenvalues.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The extremely long lifetime of the proton points to the existence of substructure.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The EFT with pion, electrons, and protons gives an unacceptably short lifetime for the proton.</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Fine tuning example?)
